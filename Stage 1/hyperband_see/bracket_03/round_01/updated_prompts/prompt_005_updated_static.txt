When labeling each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by carefully examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Here are key guidelines to assist in accurate intent discovery:

1. **Clarify Intent Identification**:
   - Identify messages that convey the same intent despite different expressions (e.g., "Yes please, that would be great." and "Perfect, thank you." should both be labeled as 'accept_solution'). Emphasize recognizing varied phrasing for similar intents.

2. **Enhance Differentiation of Actions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between messages with different actions or outcomes (e.g., "Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card." should be labeled 'report_problem', while "Yes, I tried both. Still doesn't work." should be 'confirm_attempted_solution').

3. **Highlight the Need for Granularity**:
   - Focus on specific actions or outcomes in messages (e.g., "You’re very welcome! Let me know if you need more help after resetting." should be 'offer_followup' and "No, that’s all. Have a nice day!" should be 'end_request').

4. **Encourage Contextual Analysis**:
   - Use context and conversation flow to determine intent (e.g., "I understand, that must be frustrating. Have you tried rescanning it or adding it to the app?" should be 'suggest_troubleshooting', and "Thanks. That code is only valid for orders above $50." should be 'explain_restriction').

5. **Improve Label Specificity**:
   - Create labels that encapsulate both the action and context (e.g., "Done, your profile has been updated." should have a distinct label from "Got it. I’ve updated your delivery slot to 6–8 pm." by considering the specific updates being confirmed).

6. **Balance Specificity and Generalization**:
   - Find a balance between broad and specific categories (e.g., "Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me." and "Thanks, that works." should consistently be labeled as 'express_gratitude' to avoid false splits).

7. **Distinguish Function in Similar Responses**:
   - Differentiate responses with similar wording but different functions (e.g., "That would be great, thanks!" should be labeled 'accept_solution', while "That’s helpful, thanks!" should be 'express_gratitude', based on their contextual function).

By integrating these guidelines, you'll enhance your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, improving the effectiveness of intent clustering.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
