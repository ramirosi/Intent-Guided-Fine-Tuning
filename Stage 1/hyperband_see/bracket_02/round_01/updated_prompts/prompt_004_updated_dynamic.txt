Determine the true intent or purpose of each interaction between a customer and an assistant by analyzing both the wording and context. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Group messages with the same underlying purpose, regardless of phrasing differences. For example, both "Glad I could help!" and "Happy to help! Have a nice day." share the "close_conversation" intent. Focus on the core purpose behind the wording.

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Examine the specific content and action described to identify distinct intents, even for similar messages. Differentiate between intents like "ask_clarification" and "request_bill_id" by determining if the goal is to clarify a general issue or request specific information.

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Recognize phrases that, despite different wording, share the same intent. For instance, "Okay, let me check." and "Perfect, Iâ€™ll try that now." both indicate "acknowledge" and should be grouped under this intent.

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to understand broader intents, such as concluding an interaction or offering further help. For example, "Have a wonderful day!" and "Take care!" both indicate a "close_conversation" intent.

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Break down complex interactions into multiple intents. For example, "Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?" should be separated into "apologize" and "ask_order_number" to reflect different conversation stages.

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Focus on specific details that separate intents, even if they seem related. Distinguish between "confirm_update" and "provide_order_number" by identifying the specific action or information being confirmed or provided.

By following these guidelines, accurately categorize each interaction to enhance clustering accuracy in customer service messages.
