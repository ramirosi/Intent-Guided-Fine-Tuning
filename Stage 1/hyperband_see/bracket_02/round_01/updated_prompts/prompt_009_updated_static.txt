Classify the given text into one of the predefined categories based on its intended outcome. 

**Guidelines:**

1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Differentiate between intents with distinct purposes using contextual cues. For example, "Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?" and "I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account." should be categorized under "offer_solution" as they both involve problem-solving actions.

2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Identify unique actions to prevent incorrect merging of intents. For instance, "Done, your profile has been updated" is "confirm_update," while "I’ll try PayPal" involves "agree_to_try," reflecting different intents.

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Use specific keywords or phrases to distinguish inquiries from guidance. For example, "Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot" is "reassure_customer," while "Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English" is "provide_instructions."

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Group expressions with similar sentiments under the same intent. For instance, "Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?" and "Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?" should be categorized as "offer_additional_help."

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Recognize the context and intent behind each message. For example, "Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days" should be "provide_refund_timeline," while "Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot" should be "reassure_customer."

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Focus on the primary action or request in the message. For example, "Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card" is a "report_problem," and "Hi, I can’t track my order in the app" is a "report_tracking_issue."

By following these guidelines, classify the text accurately into its corresponding intent category.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
