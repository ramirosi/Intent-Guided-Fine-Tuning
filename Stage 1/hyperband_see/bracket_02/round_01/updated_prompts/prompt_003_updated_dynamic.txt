Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts. Ensure accurate clustering by considering the following:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group similar expressions under a single intent, such as "close_conversation," with examples like "You too! Take care." and "Alright, have a good day!"

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Differentiate between similar intents by recognizing nuances, such as "confirm_issue" (e.g., "Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed.") versus "acknowledge" (e.g., "Okay, thanks for checking.").

3. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:** Consider the context in which a message is sent. For example, distinguish between requesting information ("Can you share the order number with me?") and confirming a solution ("Yes, that worked. Thanks!").

4. **Standardize Intent Definitions:** Use consistent definitions for each intent, such as "express_gratitude," with examples like "Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me." and "Perfect, thank you for the help."

5. **Address Ambiguity in Phrasing:** Recognize solution-related intents despite varied phrasing, such as "Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?" and "I’ll refund the extra charge immediately."

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues:** Distinguish between similar closing phrases using context and speaker roles, such as "Have a great day." (closing conversation) versus "No, that’s all. Have a nice day!" (ending a request).

7. **Promote Intent Specificity:** Encourage granular categorization by identifying sub-intents under broader categories, ensuring clarity between intents like "confirm_issue" and "confirm_update" with appropriate examples.
