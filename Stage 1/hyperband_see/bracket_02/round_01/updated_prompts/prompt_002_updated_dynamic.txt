Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like "You’re welcome!" and "Alright, have a good day!" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for "Done, your profile has been updated." and `describe_error_message` for "Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify "Yes please, that would be great." as `accept_solution` and "Yes, it’s 99420." as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, "Okay, thanks for checking." should be `acknowledge` while "Okay, thanks for the advice." should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify "No, that’s all. Have a nice day!" as `end_request` and "Happy to help! Have a nice day." as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both "Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days." and "Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days." should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, "Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?" and "Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify "You’re very welcome! Have a great day." as `close_conversation` and "No, that’s all. Have a nice day!" as `end_request`.

By following these guidelines, ensure accurate and consistent classification of customer support messages based on their true intents.
