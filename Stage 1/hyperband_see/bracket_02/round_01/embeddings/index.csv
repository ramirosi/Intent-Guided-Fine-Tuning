4,e9b36f0f760024b9,"Categorize each interaction between a customer and an assistant by examining both the wording and the context to determine the true intent or purpose of the message. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Recognize when messages should be grouped under a single intent versus when they should be split. Variations in phrasing do not indicate different intents if the underlying purpose is the same. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" both serve the intent of ""close_conversation"".

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Focus on the specific issue or action being described, rather than general similarities. Identify unique aspects of the message content that signal different intents, such as distinguishing between ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Identify common phrases that share the same intent despite appearing different. For example, ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" and ""Got it, thanks."" both express ""express_gratitude"".

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual cues to identify the broader intent, such as offering further assistance or closing the conversation. Messages like ""Happy to help! Anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both offer ""offer_additional_help"".

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Recognize that complex interactions may involve multiple distinct intents. Break down messages to discern different stages or aspects of the conversation, such as distinguishing ""report_problem"" from ""confirm_attempted_solution"".

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Look for specific problem descriptions that differentiate intents, even when they seem related. For example, ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."" and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be separate as ""describe_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

By following these guidelines, you can accurately categorize each interaction to improve the clustering accuracy of customer service messages."
5,4c9712713017d414,"Classify the given text into one of the predefined categories based on its intended outcome. 

**Guidelines:**
1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate similar intents. For example, phrases like ""You're welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should be grouped under ""close_conversation,"" whereas ""Thank you"" belongs to ""express_gratitude.""
   
2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Focus on the distinct action or response expected. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" should be categorized as ""confirm_update,"" while ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" falls under ""confirm_overcharge.""

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Look for keywords indicating a question (e.g., ""Could you,"" ""Can you"") versus a statement (e.g., ""You can,"" ""It is possible"") to differentiate intents like ""ask_new_address"" and ""provide_guidance.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Recognize that different phrasings can map to the same intent. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" both belong to ""close_conversation.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Consider the context and the action or reassurance being communicated. For example, ""Yes, you’ll receive an email"" should be ""confirm_process,"" while ""If you don’t see the email"" should be ""give_tip.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Identify the primary action or request. For example, ""Got it. Do you want to apply this change"" is a request for confirmation, while ""Hi, I can’t track my order"" indicates a request for assistance.

By following these guidelines, classify the text accurately into its corresponding intent category."
6,dbc8758ba528e56b,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

Differentiate between intents like ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" by determining if the goal is to clarify a general issue or request specific information.

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Recognize phrases that, despite different wording, share the same intent. For instance, ""Okay, let me check."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both indicate ""acknowledge"" and should be grouped under this intent.

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to understand broader intents, such as concluding an interaction or offering further help. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Take care!"" both indicate a ""close_conversation"" intent.

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Break down complex interactions into multiple intents. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be separated into ""apologize"" and ""ask_order_number"" to reflect different conversation stages.
