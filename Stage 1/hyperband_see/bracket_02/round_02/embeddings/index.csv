0,cfafb6ecc4c38842,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize grouping similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" to avoid false splits. For example, phrases like ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" and ""You too! Take care."" should consistently be categorized together.

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Highlight specific language cues to differentiate between similar intents. For instance, distinguish ""ask_clarification"" (""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"") from ""request_order_number"" (""Can you share the order number with me?"").

3. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:** Understand the context to accurately identify intents, especially in troubleshooting scenarios. For example, recognize ""I understand, that must be frustrating. Have you tried rescanning it or adding it to the app?"" as ""suggest_troubleshooting.""

4. **Standardize Intent Definitions:** Provide consistent examples to support each intent, such as using phrases like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me,"" for ""express_gratitude,"" to maintain clarity.

5. **Address Ambiguity in Phrasing:** Offer guidance on identifying solution-related intents, regardless of phrasing differences. For example, both ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" should be categorized under the same solution-related intent.

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues:** Include cues for distinguishing similar closing phrases, using context and speaker roles to aid in clarification. For example, ""Have a great day"" can serve as a closing remark or end a service request, depending on context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity:** Highlight the need for granular categorization by providing examples of sub-intents within broader categories, such as separating ""confirm_attempted_solution"" from ""express_gratitude.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages."
1,dbc8758ba528e56b,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

By following these guidelines, ensure accurate and consistent classification of customer support messages based on their true intents."
