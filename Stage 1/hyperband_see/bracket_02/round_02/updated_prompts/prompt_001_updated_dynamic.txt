Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly differentiate between intents with similar functions. For example, distinguish between `ask_error_details` ("Sorry to hear that! Are you getting an error message?") and `request_receipt_number` ("Can you share your receipt number?").

2. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle differences in context or phrasing to accurately classify intents. For example, differentiate between `express_gratitude` ("Appreciate the help!") and `acknowledge` ("Got it, thanks.").

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Use consistent labels for messages leading to the same outcome. For instance, both "Glad I could help!" and "You’re very welcome" should be classified as `close_conversation`.

4. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents in a single message. For example, "You’re welcome. I’ll keep tracking your order until it’s delivered," should include both `express_gratitude` and `confirm_followup`.

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to avoid false splits. For example, "Great. Have a wonderful day!" and "Glad I could help!" should map to `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. For instance, distinguish "I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded" (`offer_solution`) from "I’ll refund the extra charge immediately" (`confirm_solution`).

7. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate intents that might seem similar. For example, separate `ask_new_address` from `report_voucher_issue` to avoid misclassification.

8. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Clarify and redefine overlapping intents to improve accuracy. For example, separate `end_request` ("No, that’s all. Have a nice day!") from `close_conversation` ("You’re very welcome! Have a great day.").

By applying these guidelines, achieve accurate and consistent classification of customer support messages based on their true intents.
