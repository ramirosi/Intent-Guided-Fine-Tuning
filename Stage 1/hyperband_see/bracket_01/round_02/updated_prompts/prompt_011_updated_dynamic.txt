### Refined Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This involves tagging each response with a specific intent label to effectively guide the conversation. Follow these enhanced instructions for precise intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Define each intent clearly and provide examples to prevent confusion. For instance, differentiate between "confirm_update" and "confirm_overcharge" with examples such as "Done, your profile has been updated" for "confirm_update" and "Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery" for "confirm_overcharge."

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For example, consistently tag "No, that’s all. Have a nice day!" as "close_conversation" to avoid splitting into "end_request" or "close_conversation" based on minor wording variations.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how context can alter a message's intent. For instance, differentiate "I’ll try PayPal" as "agree_to_try" and "Perfect, I’ll try that now" as "acknowledge," using context to guide intent recognition.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid unnecessary granularity unless it aligns with business objectives. For example, decide when to split intents like "provide_instructions" and "provide_guidance" based on their business significance.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Offer detailed examples of false merges to clarify intent distinctions. For instance, distinguish "Hello, I want to update my delivery address" as "request_update_address" from "Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield" as "provide_new_address."

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Group intents based on broader goals. Ensure all phrases aiming to close a conversation are tagged under "close_conversation," regardless of wording differences.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Suggest strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as using previous interactions to differentiate intents like "end_request" and "close_conversation." Clarify when "No, that’s everything" should be an "end_request" versus "close_conversation."

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include diverse examples, particularly from error cases, to guide correct categorization. Differentiate intents like "offer_solution" and "suggest_troubleshooting" by considering scenarios where context determines the intent, such as offering a refund versus suggesting a fix.

By applying these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and consistency of intent identification in customer service interactions, enhancing the overall customer experience.
