Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Evaluate the role of each message in the conversation to correctly identify its intent. For example, in a billing issue context, "I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account" should be understood as "offer_solution."

- **Refine Instructions for Distinguishing Closing Statements:** Differentiate between expressions that close a conversation and those that offer gratitude. For instance, "Great. Have a wonderful day!" should be categorized as "close_conversation," while "No, that’s everything" should be recognized as "end_request."

- **Improve Differentiation of Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples to distinguish similar intents, such as "provide_refund_timeline" versus general refund information. Statements like "Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days" should fall under "provide_refund_timeline."

- **Incorporate Examples for Disambiguating Instructions and Solutions:** Use examples like "I’ll refund the extra charge immediately" for "offer_solution" and "You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen" for "provide_instructions."

- **Highlight the Need for Consistent Acknowledgment Clustering:** Use context to decide whether acknowledgment phrases like "Okay, thanks for checking" and "Perfect, I’ll try that now" should be combined into a single intent or kept separate.

- **Address Multi-Intent Messages Clearly:** Illustrate how to handle messages with multiple intents. For example, "Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?" should be recognized as "offer_solution" and potentially involve other intents depending on the broader query.

- **Provide Clear Guidelines for Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents exist within a single message and classify them accurately without false merges.

- **Include Examples of Gratitude as a Distinct Intent:** Demonstrate situations where gratitude should be a standalone intent, such as "That’s helpful, thanks!" to prevent incorrect merges with other intents.

By implementing these guidelines, ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing the likelihood of false splits and merges.
