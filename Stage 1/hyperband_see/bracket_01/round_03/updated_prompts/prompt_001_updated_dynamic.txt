Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as "You’re very welcome!" and "Glad I could help!", and expressions of gratitude, like "Thank you for helping me". Categorize them as "close_conversation" and "express_gratitude" respectively, unless they appear in a closing sequence. For example, "Perfect, thank you for the help" should be "close_conversation".

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, "Yes, that worked. Thanks!" should be split into "confirm_solution" and "express_gratitude", while "That’s helpful, thanks!" should be categorized as "express_gratitude".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like "Okay, thanks for checking." and "Okay, let me check." fall under "acknowledge" or if they indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as "Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?", which includes "offer_help" and "inquire_further_assistance". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify "Yes, it’s 58291." and "It’s 67221." as "provide_order_number" if they respond to a request for an order number.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like "That’s helpful, thanks!", as distinct intents unless they serve a dual purpose.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.
