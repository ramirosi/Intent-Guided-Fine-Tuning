### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on merging intents that serve similar functions. For example, combine "acknowledge_and_thank" with "express_gratitude" unless there are explicit reasons to keep them separate. Use examples such as "customer: Okay, I’ll do that now. Thanks for your support!" and "customer: Perfect, thank you for the help." to illustrate this consolidation.

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases to avoid false splits. For instance, "Yes please, that would be great." and "Perfect, thank you." should both be tagged as "accept_solution." Use these phrases to demonstrate the importance of consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how conversation context can alter intent interpretation. For example, "Okay, let me check." can imply "acknowledge" or "accept_solution" depending on preceding messages. Use examples like "customer: That would be good." and "customer: Oh, I didn’t realize." to show context's impact on intent.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions unless necessary for business objectives. Illustrate this by addressing errors such as tagging "provide_refund_timeline" and "provide_instructions" separately without clear differentiation.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to show how context alters intent, preventing false merges. For instance, differentiate "customer: Awesome, appreciate the help!" from "customer: Perfect, thank you." as "express_gratitude" and "accept_solution" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their overarching goal. For example, all phrases related to closing should fall under "close_conversation," regardless of specific wording. Use examples like "No, that’s all. Have a nice day!" to emphasize this point.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as analyzing the conversation stage or prior interactions. For example, differentiate between "end_request" and "close_conversation" based on whether further action is implied.

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a wider range of examples to cover common pitfalls. For instance, differentiate "report_billing_issue" from "report_overcharge" with scenarios like "customer: I think I was overcharged on my last bill." vs. "customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.
