Categorize each interaction based on its intent or action with the following guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Ensure similar expressions are consistently categorized under the same intent:
   - "close_conversation": Use for expressions that conclude the interaction (e.g., "Glad I could help!", "You’re very welcome!", "Take care!", "Thank you for reaching out!")

2. **Disambiguate Gratitude and Solution Confirmation**: Differentiate between gratitude and solution confirmation, even if they appear together:
   - "confirm_solution": Focus on verifying the solution worked (e.g., "Yes, that worked.")
   - "express_gratitude": Focus on thankfulness (e.g., "Thanks for your help!")

3. **Utilize Contextual Cues for Assistants**: Identify the primary purpose of assistant messages through context:
   - "provide_refund_timeline": Specific information about refund timing (e.g., "Your refund will be processed in 3-5 days.")
   - "reassure_customer": General reassurance without specific timelines (e.g., "We’re here to help with any issues.")

4. **Maintain Consistent Categorization**: Ensure distinct intents remain separate:
   - "ask_order_number": Direct request for order details (e.g., "Can you provide your order number?")
   - "reassure_customer": Comforting messages (e.g., "Don't worry, we’ll sort this out.")

5. **Expand Closing Intent Examples**: Include a variety of closing phrases under "close_conversation":
   - Examples: "Have a great day!", "Talk to you soon!", "You're welcome, anytime!"

6. **Differentiate Between Requests and Instructions**: Clarify distinctions between requests and inquiries:
   - "request_order_number": Direct request (e.g., "Please give me your order number.")
   - "ask_order_number": More general inquiry (e.g., "Could I have your order number?")

7. **Illustrate Overlapping Intents**: Provide scenarios where intents transition:
   - Example: From "offer_additional_help" to "close_conversation" as the dialogue wraps up.

8. **Prioritize Message Purpose**: Focus on the main intent when gratitude and confirmation coexist:
   - "confirm_solution": When the main purpose is verifying success (e.g., "Yes, that's fixed. Thanks!")

9. **Promote Iterative Review**: Regularly revisit and refine intent categories to enhance clarity and reduce errors as new patterns emerge.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
