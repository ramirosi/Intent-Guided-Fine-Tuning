Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Follow these refined guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Provide clear definitions to differentiate similar intents:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without explicit gratitude. Example: "Okay, let me check."
     - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Example: "That’s helpful, thanks!"

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: "Yes, that worked. Thanks!"
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: "You’re very welcome!" and "Alright, have a good day!"

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Strengthen differentiation cues for intents like "Acknowledge" versus "Express_Gratitude". Explicit gratitude terms such as "thanks" or "appreciate" should be categorized as "Express_Gratitude".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Maintain uniformity in labeling similar responses. For instance, both "You’re very welcome!" and "Glad I could help!" should be labeled as "Close_Conversation".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Provide clear instructions for messages with multiple intents. Decide whether to split into separate intents or choose a primary one, e.g., "Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me." could be split into "Acknowledge" and "Express_Gratitude".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between overlapping intents like "Offer_Additional_Help" and "Close_Conversation". For example, "Is there anything else I can do for you today?" should be categorized as "Offer_Additional_Help".

7. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Use context to interpret ambiguous phrases, ensuring specificity. For instance, differentiate "offer_alternative_updates" from "explain_issue" by context in messages like "I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives."

8. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Emphasize the importance of regularly updating intent categories to reflect changes in customer interaction patterns, minimizing errors like "false_merge" and "false_split".

9. **Illustrate with Error Examples:**
   - Use specific examples to illustrate common mistakes and corrections. For instance, separate "Great, how long will the refund take?" from "ask_order_number" to clarify distinct intents.

By implementing these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and consistency of intent categorization in customer service interactions.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        
 Return the output in EXACT format as specified below:
                                
        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
