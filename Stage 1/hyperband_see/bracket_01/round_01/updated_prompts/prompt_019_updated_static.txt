Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content, with a strong focus on differentiating between customer and assistant roles. Emphasize the importance of context in determining intent, using examples to illustrate how the same phrases can have different meanings depending on the speaker. Recognize distinct intents, such as "provide_refund_timeline" and "offer_additional_help," even if they relate to the same topic. Include examples of false splits and merges to clarify intent distinctions, and suggest using follow-up interactions for disambiguation. Highlight the need to distinguish between conversation closings and task completions, and provide clear guidelines for handling messages with multiple intents. Prioritize contextual analysis to ensure accurate and specific classification.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
