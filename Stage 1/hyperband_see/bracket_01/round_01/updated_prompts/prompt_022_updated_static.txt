Classify each statement as either "customer" or "assistant" and provide a corresponding intent label.

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: "To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts."

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: "You too! Take care."

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: "Is there anything else I can assist you with?"

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding, agreement, or readiness to proceed.
   - Example: "Okay, thanks for checking." or "Perfect, I’ll try that now."

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: "That’s helpful, thanks!"

6. **Provide Refund Timeline**: Informing about the duration for processing a refund.
   - Example: "Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."

7. **Request Order Number**: Asking the customer to provide their order number.
   - Example: "Can you share the order number with me?"

8. **Confirm Issue**: Verifying or clarifying the problem or concern presented.
   - Example: "So, the item was damaged on arrival?"

9. **Give Tip**: Offering helpful suggestions without detailed steps.
   - Example: "It might help to restart your device."

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, "You’re very welcome!" and "Glad I could help!" should both be labeled as "close_conversation."
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases can signal readiness to proceed or confirm understanding.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.
- Maintain separate intents for messages that convey different actions or requests, even if they appear in quick succession.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Encourage ongoing review and refinement based on new data or ambiguous cases.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for users to flag difficult-to-classify messages for further analysis and definition adjustment.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        
 Return the output in EXACT format as specified below:
                                
        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
