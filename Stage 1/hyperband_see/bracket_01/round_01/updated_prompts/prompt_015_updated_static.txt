Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Below are guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Clearly differentiate between similar intents, such as:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without further action. Example: "Okay, let me check."
     - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: "Yes, that worked. Thanks!"

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Examples: "That’s helpful, thanks!" and "Got it, thanks."
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: "You’re very welcome!" and "Alright, have a good day!"

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - For intents like "Acknowledge" versus "Express_Gratitude", look for explicit gratitude terms to categorize as "Express_Gratitude".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Ensure uniformity in labeling similar responses. E.g., categorize both "You’re very welcome!" and "Alright, have a good day!" as "Close_Conversation".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Decide on a consistent approach for messages like "Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me." Determine if they should be split into separate intents or fall under a broader category like "Express_Gratitude".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between "Offer_Additional_Help" and "Close_Conversation". For instance, "Is there anything else I can do for you today?" should be marked as "Offer_Additional_Help".

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically evaluate and adjust intent categories to ensure they align with evolving customer interaction trends.

8. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Provide specific instructions for phrases that may fit multiple intents. Use context cues to determine the most appropriate intent.

By following these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and clarity of intent categorization in customer service interactions.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        
 Return the output in EXACT format as specified below:
                                
        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
