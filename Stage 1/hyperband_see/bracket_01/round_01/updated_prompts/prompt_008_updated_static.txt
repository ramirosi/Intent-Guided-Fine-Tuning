Classify the given customer or assistant statement into the appropriate intent category. Consider the conversational context and use the following guidelines:

1. **express_gratitude**: Recognize expressions of thanks or appreciation, such as "Thank you for helping me" or "That’s helpful, thanks!"

2. **acknowledge**: Use this for responses that indicate understanding or agreement, including phrases like "Okay, thanks for checking." and "Okay, let me check."

3. **provide_instructions**: Group statements that offer guidance or steps, such as "You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password'" and "You can change it in Settings."

4. **offer_additional_help**: Identify when the assistant explicitly offers further assistance, e.g., "Is there anything else I can help you with?"

5. **close_conversation**: Use this for messages that signal the end of the dialogue, like "You’re very welcome!" and "Alright, have a good day!"

Ensure you analyze the context to accurately classify each statement, and refer to examples to avoid confusion between similar intents. Consider merging categories if necessary to simplify classification.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        
 Return the output in EXACT format as specified below:
                                
        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
