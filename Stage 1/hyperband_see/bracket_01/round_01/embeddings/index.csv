10,0a9eac747bc15797,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between intents such as ""request_order_number"" (where a customer is explicitly asking for their order number) and ""ask_order_number"" (where a customer might be inquiring if they need to provide their order number).

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Recognize that similar phrases often share the same intent. For example, phrases like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation."" Maintain consistency across similar expressions.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Understand that different phrases can convey the same intent. For instance, ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should both be categorized under the ""acknowledge"" intent.

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use contextual cues to distinguish between intents. For example, the intent behind ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (likely ""close_conversation"") differs from ""No, that’s all"" (possibly ""end_request"") based on conversation context.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Aim for a balanced level of granularity. Avoid overly detailed distinctions like ""request_order_number"" vs. ""ask_order_number"" unless necessary for specific business goals.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Use examples such as ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" to illustrate how similar queries can reflect different intents, such as ""apology"" versus ""request_order_number,"" depending on context and phrasing.

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents based on the underlying goal of the message. For instance, all forms of closing statements should be under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Implement strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses."

12,8632b615b90aa14c,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group expressions that close a conversation together, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from standalone expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me.""

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Differentiate between gratitude and confirmation. For example, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be seen as a ""confirm_solution"" followed by ""express_gratitude,"" whereas ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" primarily expresses gratitude.

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Maintain consistency in grouping similar acknowledgments. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped based on context unless differentiated by specific actions.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents are present within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" which offers help and seeks further engagement.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use conversation context to determine intents, such as classifying both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" under ""provide_order_number.""

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges, using examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to show when gratitude is a distinct intent.

Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiate between closely related intents, and use consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Identify Similar Intents:**
   - Example: ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!"" both have the intent: close_conversation.

2. **Differentiate Close Intents:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" has the intent: express_gratitude, while ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge.

3. **Consistent Language Use:**
   - Use standardized terminology for similar requests, such as ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" both having the intent: request_order_number.

4. **Encourage Intent Grouping:**
   - Example: ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""assistant: Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both have the intent: offer_additional_help.

5. **Refine Acknowledgment vs. Gratitude:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge, while ""customer: Got it, thanks."" has the intent: express_gratitude.
