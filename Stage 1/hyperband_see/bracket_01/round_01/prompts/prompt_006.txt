Classify each statement as either "customer" or "assistant" and provide a corresponding intent label. 

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: "To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts."

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: "You too! Take care."

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: "Is there anything else I can assist you with?"

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding or agreement, often with neutral responses.
   - Example: "Okay, let me check."

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: "That’s helpful, thanks!"

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, "You’re very welcome!" and "Glad I could help!" should both be labeled as "close_conversation."
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases are often neutral confirmations, while gratitude phrases express thanks.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Cross-reference with other examples to ensure accurate intent classification.
- Incorporate a review step to prevent false merges of distinct intents.
