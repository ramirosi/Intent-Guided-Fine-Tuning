Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group expressions that close a conversation together, such as "You’re very welcome!" and "Glad I could help!" Distinguish these from standalone expressions of gratitude like "Thank you for helping me."

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Differentiate between gratitude and confirmation. For example, "Yes, that worked. Thanks!" should be seen as a "confirm_solution" followed by "express_gratitude," whereas "That’s helpful, thanks!" primarily expresses gratitude.

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Maintain consistency in grouping similar acknowledgments. Phrases like "Okay, thanks for checking." and "Okay, let me check." should be grouped based on context unless differentiated by specific actions.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents are present within a single message, such as "Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?" which offers help and seeks further engagement.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use conversation context to determine intents, such as classifying both "Yes, it’s 58291." and "It’s 67221." under "provide_order_number."

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges, using examples like "That’s helpful, thanks!" and "Yes, that worked. Thanks!" to show when gratitude is a distinct intent.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing false splits and merges.
