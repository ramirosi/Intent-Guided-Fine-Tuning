Classify the given customer or assistant statement into the appropriate intent category. Consider the conversational context and use the following guidelines:

1. **express_gratitude**: Recognize expressions of thanks or appreciation, such as "Thank you for helping me" or "That’s helpful, thanks!"

2. **acknowledge**: Use this for responses that indicate understanding or agreement, including phrases like "Okay, thanks for checking." and "Okay, let me check."

3. **provide_instructions**: Group statements that offer guidance or steps, such as "You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password'" and "You can change it in Settings."

4. **offer_additional_help**: Identify when the assistant explicitly offers further assistance, e.g., "Is there anything else I can help you with?"

5. **close_conversation**: Use this for messages that signal the end of the dialogue, like "You’re very welcome!" and "Alright, have a good day!"

Ensure you analyze the context to accurately classify each statement, and refer to examples to avoid confusion between similar intents. Consider merging categories if necessary to simplify classification.
