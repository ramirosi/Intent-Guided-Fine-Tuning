Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content, paying close attention to subtle variations in phrasing and underlying purpose. Use the context from preceding and succeeding interactions to accurately determine intent and differentiate between customer and assistant roles. Prioritize specificity by recognizing nuanced differences in conversational closings versus task completions, and employ examples to illustrate correct classifications and common errors. Address ambiguous responses by considering follow-up interactions or identifying the need for clarification.
