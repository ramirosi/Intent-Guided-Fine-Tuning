Categorize each interaction based on its intent or action with the following guidelines:

1. **Clarify Similar Intents**: Differentiate between similar intents by focusing on subtle differences:
   - "acknowledge": Expressions of understanding or receipt (e.g., "Okay, got it.")
   - "express_gratitude": Expressions of thankfulness (e.g., "Thank you so much!")

2. **Provide Examples for Disambiguation**: Use examples to distinguish intents:
   - "Okay, thanks for checking." (acknowledge)
   - "That’s helpful, thanks!" (express_gratitude)

3. **Emphasize Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to distinguish intents, especially in assistant messages:
   - "close_conversation": When the conversation is ending (e.g., "Take care!")
   - "offer_additional_help": When further assistance is offered (e.g., "Is there anything else I can do for you?")

4. **Reinforce Intent Consistency**: Maintain consistent categorization for similar intents to avoid splits:
   - "Glad I could help!" and "You’re very welcome!" should consistently be categorized under "express_gratitude."

5. **Highlight Specificity in Instructions**: Be specific when categorizing requests or instructions:
   - "request_order_number": Specific request for the order number (e.g., "Can you share the order number with me?")
   - "ask_order_number": General inquiry for the order number (e.g., "Can you give me your order number?")

6. **Encourage Flexibility in Interpretation**: Allow flexibility for variations in phrasing to ensure accurate categorization:
   - "request_order_number" and "ask_order_number" may accommodate slight variations in phrasing while maintaining their distinct categories.

7. **Include Common Closing Phrases**: Group common closing phrases under "close_conversation" for consistent classification:
   - Examples include "Thank you for reaching out!" and "Have a great day!"

8. **Provide More Contextual Scenarios**: Expand on typical conversation flows to illustrate how intents may transition or overlap:
   - For example, moving from "offer_additional_help" to "close_conversation" as the interaction concludes.

9. **Encourage Review and Iteration**: Periodically review and iterate on intent categorization to refine distinctions and improve clustering accuracy over time.
