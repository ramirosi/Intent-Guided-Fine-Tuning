   - ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" should consistently be categorized under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Highlight Specificity in Instructions**: Be specific when categorizing requests or instructions:
   - ""request_order_number"": Specific request for the order number (e.g., ""Can you share the order number with me?"")
   - ""ask_order_number"": General inquiry for the order number (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"")

   - Examples include ""Thank you for reaching out!"" and ""Have a great day!""

8. **Provide More Contextual Scenarios**: Expand on typical conversation flows to illustrate how intents may transition or overlap:
   - For example, moving from ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the interaction concludes.

10,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between intents such as ""request_order_number"" (where a customer is explicitly asking for their order number) and ""ask_order_number"" (where a customer might be inquiring if they need to provide their order number).

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Recognize that similar phrases often share the same intent. For example, phrases like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation."" Maintain consistency across similar expressions.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Understand that different phrases can convey the same intent. For instance, ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should both be categorized under the ""acknowledge"" intent.

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use contextual cues to distinguish between intents. For example, the intent behind ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (likely ""close_conversation"") differs from ""No, that’s all"" (possibly ""end_request"") based on conversation context.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Aim for a balanced level of granularity. Avoid overly detailed distinctions like ""request_order_number"" vs. ""ask_order_number"" unless necessary for specific business goals.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Use examples such as ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" to illustrate how similar queries can reflect different intents, such as ""apology"" versus ""request_order_number,"" depending on context and phrasing.

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents based on the underlying goal of the message. For instance, all forms of closing statements should be under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Implement strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.3808945168581792,0.7729468599033816,0.3720930232558139,0.2944112207599453,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

12,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group expressions that close a conversation together, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from standalone expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me.""

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Differentiate between gratitude and confirmation. For example, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be seen as a ""confirm_solution"" followed by ""express_gratitude,"" whereas ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" primarily expresses gratitude.

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Maintain consistency in grouping similar acknowledgments. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped based on context unless differentiated by specific actions.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents are present within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" which offers help and seeks further engagement.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use conversation context to determine intents, such as classifying both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" under ""provide_order_number.""

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges, using examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to show when gratitude is a distinct intent.

13,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiate between closely related intents, and use consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Identify Similar Intents:**
   - Example: ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!"" both have the intent: close_conversation.

2. **Differentiate Close Intents:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" has the intent: express_gratitude, while ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge.

3. **Consistent Language Use:**
   - Use standardized terminology for similar requests, such as ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" both having the intent: request_order_number.

4. **Encourage Intent Grouping:**
   - Example: ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""assistant: Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both have the intent: offer_additional_help.

5. **Refine Acknowledgment vs. Gratitude:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge, while ""customer: Got it, thanks."" has the intent: express_gratitude.

6. **Disambiguate Instructional Content:**
   - Example: ""assistant: No worries. You can reset it by tapping “Forgot password” on the login screen."" and ""assistant: Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English."" both have the intent: provide_instructions.

7. **Highlight Intent Continuity:**
   - Example: ""customer: No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" and ""customer: No, that’s all."" both have the intent: end_request.

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding or agreement, often with neutral responses.
   - Example: ""Okay, let me check.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases are often neutral confirmations, while gratitude phrases express thanks.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Cross-reference with other examples to ensure accurate intent classification.
- Incorporate a review step to prevent false merges of distinct intents.",6.0,,,0.2292799157896447,0.5185093167701863,0.1614906832298136,0.1188837724852145,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

15,feedback_0,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Below are guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Clearly differentiate between similar intents, such as:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without further action. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Examples: ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - For intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"", look for explicit gratitude terms to categorize as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Ensure uniformity in labeling similar responses. E.g., categorize both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Decide on a consistent approach for messages like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" Determine if they should be split into separate intents or fall under a broader category like ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For instance, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be marked as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically evaluate and adjust intent categories to ensure they align with evolving customer interaction trends.

8. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Provide specific instructions for phrases that may fit multiple intents. Use context cues to determine the most appropriate intent.

By following these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and clarity of intent categorization in customer service interactions.",7.0,,,0.3644745725009509,0.7728260869565217,0.3103448275862068,0.2816754576610609,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

1. **express_gratitude**: Recognize expressions of thanks or appreciation without implying conversation closure, such as ""Thank you for helping me"" or ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

2. **acknowledge**: Use this for responses that indicate understanding or agreement, without further questioning, including phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check.""

3. **provide_instructions**: Group statements that offer detailed step-by-step guidance, such as ""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password'"" and ""You can change it in Settings.""

4. **give_tip**: Identify suggestions or advice not directly instructing the user on a specific action, e.g., ""If you don’t see the email, please check your spam folder.""

5. **confirm_process**: Define this category for confirming a process will occur, without providing additional instructions, such as ""Your refund is being processed.""

6. **ask_followup**: Classify customer inquiries seeking additional details, beyond mere acknowledgment, like ""Will I get a reset email?""

7. **close_conversation**: Use this for messages that explicitly indicate the end of an interaction, whether or not they contain gratitude, like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **resolve_issue**: Consolidate statements related to solutions and timelines for resolving issues, such as ""The refund will be processed in 3-5 days"" and ""We can offer you a replacement.""

7. **Illustrate Overlapping Intents**: Provide scenarios where intents transition:
   - Example: From ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the dialogue wraps up.

8. **Prioritize Message Purpose**: Focus on the main intent when gratitude and confirmation coexist:
   - ""confirm_solution"": When the main purpose is verifying success (e.g., ""Yes, that's fixed. Thanks!"")

18,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.4430388052552682,0.9128787878787878,0.3555555555555555,0.4044407275246955,"[18. 22. 15.  4. 13.  2. 16.  9. 11.  7.  3. 21. 15.  8. 17.  0. 12.  9.

20,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

22,feedback_1,"Classify each statement as either ""customer"" or ""assistant"" and provide a corresponding intent label.

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding, agreement, or readiness to proceed.
   - Example: ""Okay, thanks for checking."" or ""Perfect, I’ll try that now.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

6. **Provide Refund Timeline**: Informing about the duration for processing a refund.
   - Example: ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days.""

7. **Request Order Number**: Asking the customer to provide their order number.
   - Example: ""Can you share the order number with me?""

8. **Confirm Issue**: Verifying or clarifying the problem or concern presented.
   - Example: ""So, the item was damaged on arrival?""

9. **Give Tip**: Offering helpful suggestions without detailed steps.
   - Example: ""It might help to restart your device.""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases can signal readiness to proceed or confirm understanding.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.
- Maintain separate intents for messages that convey different actions or requests, even if they appear in quick succession.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Encourage ongoing review and refinement based on new data or ambiguous cases.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for users to flag difficult-to-classify messages for further analysis and definition adjustment.",6.0,,,0.4699180112633404,0.5492063492063491,0.3855421686746987,0.2580819553922472,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

23,feedback_1,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Follow these refined guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Provide clear definitions to differentiate similar intents:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without explicit gratitude. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Strengthen differentiation cues for intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"". Explicit gratitude terms such as ""thanks"" or ""appreciate"" should be categorized as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Maintain uniformity in labeling similar responses. For instance, both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should be labeled as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Provide clear instructions for messages with multiple intents. Decide whether to split into separate intents or choose a primary one, e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" could be split into ""Acknowledge"" and ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between overlapping intents like ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For example, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be categorized as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Use context to interpret ambiguous phrases, ensuring specificity. For instance, differentiate ""offer_alternative_updates"" from ""explain_issue"" by context in messages like ""I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives.""

8. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Emphasize the importance of regularly updating intent categories to reflect changes in customer interaction patterns, minimizing errors like ""false_merge"" and ""false_split"".

9. **Illustrate with Error Examples:**
   - Use specific examples to illustrate common mistakes and corrections. For instance, separate ""Great, how long will the refund take?"" from ""ask_order_number"" to clarify distinct intents.

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",,,,0.5734634720585122,0.9416190087145968,0.5669291338582677,0.5399841060937671,"[41.  3. 19. 48. 13. 20. 27.  0. 12. 23. 11. 36. 44. 32. 14. 27.  9. 34.

3,warm_start,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",,,,0.5226651228327732,0.9039226080042408,0.4666666666666667,0.4724488209438572,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

4,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiating between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some refined guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Enhance Recognition of Similar Phrasings for Consistent Intents:**
   - Consistently label expressions of gratitude such as ""Okay, thanks for the advice,"" ""Got it, thanks,"" and ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" as (intent: express_gratitude).

2. **Differentiate Closely Related Intents:**
   - Emphasize recognizing specific actions or agreements to differentiate intents like ""provide_payment_method"" and ""agree_to_try."" For example, distinguish ""With a credit card"" from ""I’ll try PayPal.""

3. **Clarify Intent Boundaries for Endings and Closures:**
   - Reinforce the difference between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation,"" distinguishing messages like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" from ""Great. Have a wonderful day!""

4. **Use Consistent Terminology for Similar Actions:**
   - Standardize intent labels like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" as (intent: offer_solution).

5. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Highlight the importance of context to differentiate similar intents like ""offer_additional_help"" and ""offer_alternative_updates.""

6. **Standardize Language for Common Requests:**
   - Use consistent intent labeling for requests such as ""request_order_number"" by recognizing similar phrasing.

7. **Reinforce Consistency in Closing Statements:**
   - Ensure that intents like ""close_conversation"" are consistently applied to varied phrasings like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **Disambiguate Errors and Solutions:**
   - Clarify the separation between describing an error and agreeing to a solution, as seen in messages like ""Yes, it said 'transaction declined'"" and ""I’ll try PayPal.""

5,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Stress the importance of distinguishing between expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" and standalone gratitude expressions like ""Thank you for helping me,"" unless part of a closing dialogue.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide examples to differentiate similar intents like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be primarily labeled as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Emphasize consistency when clustering acknowledgments. Use context to decide if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped together or separately, depending on the specific action each acknowledgment implies.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Illustrate when multiple intents are present in a single message. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should encompass both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance.""

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Encourage using the surrounding conversation context to accurately determine intents. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number"" based on the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

6,feedback_0,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content. 

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly distinguish intents such as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude."" Use ""close_conversation"" for messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" which aim to conclude an interaction.

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Provide distinct categories for similar intents. For instance, separate ""ask_order_number"" (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"") as they seek different information.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Ensure all expressions of thanks are consistently categorized under ""express_gratitude,"" such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use context to differentiate similar intents like ""provide_new_address"" (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."") from ""provide_guidance"" (e.g., ""If the card still fails later, contact your bank for details."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Specify when to split or merge intents based on differences, such as separating ""confirm_action"" (e.g., ""I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent."") from ""confirm_overcharge"" (e.g., ""You were indeed charged twice for delivery."").

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents like ""report_payment_failure"" (e.g., ""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"").

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing ""accept_solution"" (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders."").

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents, such as differentiating ""describe_issue"" (e.g., ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders.""). 

By following these guidelines, enhance the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.4532005658934174,0.8261070526695526,0.4508196721311475,0.3743921837583844,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

7,feedback_0,"### Improved Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",3.0,,,0.7327216376763207,0.9560090702947844,0.7560975609756097,0.7004885316198113,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

8,feedback_1,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, accurately identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, clearly distinguishing between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are refined guidelines and examples to assist you:

1. **Consistent Recognition for Acknowledgment:**
   - Ensure that acknowledgment expressions like ""Perfect, I’ll try that now,"" ""Okay, let me check,"" and ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are consistently labeled as (intent: acknowledge).

2. **Differentiate Information Requests and Solution Offers:**
   - Clearly differentiate intents such as ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" from ""offer_solution."" For example, distinguish ""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"" from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

3. **Refine Problem Reporting vs. Update Requests:**
   - Precisely differentiate intents like ""report_billing_issue"" from ""request_update_address."" For instance, distinguish ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" from ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address.""

4. **Standardize Intent Labeling for Similar Actions:**
   - Recognize similar phrasing for actions like ""offer_solution,"" such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account.""

5. **Clarify Boundaries for Similar Requests:**
   - Reinforce differentiation between similar intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"" with clear examples, such as ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" versus ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

6. **Disambiguate Confirming Actions vs. Reassuring Customers:**
   - Highlight the difference between ""confirm_action"" and ""reassure_customer."" For example, differentiate ""Perfect, I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent to your address"" from ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot.""

7. **Standardize Language for Gratitude and Closures:**
   - Consistently apply intent labels like ""close_conversation"" to varied phrasings such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!""

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding for Similar Intents:**
   - Emphasize context to distinguish similar intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""explain_issue."" For instance, contrast ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" with ""Thank you. I see the order is on its way, but the tracking system is delayed.""

9,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Evaluate the role of each message in the conversation to correctly identify its intent. For example, in a billing issue context, ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" should be understood as ""offer_solution.""

- **Refine Instructions for Distinguishing Closing Statements:** Differentiate between expressions that close a conversation and those that offer gratitude. For instance, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" should be categorized as ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s everything"" should be recognized as ""end_request.""

- **Improve Differentiation of Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples to distinguish similar intents, such as ""provide_refund_timeline"" versus general refund information. Statements like ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should fall under ""provide_refund_timeline.""

- **Incorporate Examples for Disambiguating Instructions and Solutions:** Use examples like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" for ""offer_solution"" and ""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen"" for ""provide_instructions.""

- **Highlight the Need for Consistent Acknowledgment Clustering:** Use context to decide whether acknowledgment phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" should be combined into a single intent or kept separate.

- **Address Multi-Intent Messages Clearly:** Illustrate how to handle messages with multiple intents. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" should be recognized as ""offer_solution"" and potentially involve other intents depending on the broader query.

- **Provide Clear Guidelines for Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents exist within a single message and classify them accurately without false merges.

- **Include Examples of Gratitude as a Distinct Intent:** Demonstrate situations where gratitude should be a standalone intent, such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" to prevent incorrect merges with other intents.

10,feedback_1,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content.

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly define each intent with examples. Use ""close_conversation"" for statements intended to end an interaction, such as ""Have a great day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Differentiate from ""express_gratitude,"" which includes expressions like ""Thank you for the help.""

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Create distinct categories for intents that are contextually different. For example, ""request_order_number"" involves asking for an order number, such as ""Can you share the order number with me?"" while ""ask_order_number"" might be used in different contexts.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Group similar expressions under the same intent consistently. For instance, all expressions of gratitude, including ""Perfect, thank you for the help,"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate between similar intents. For example, distinguish ""provide_instructions"" (""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen."") from ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by the nature of the message.

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Provide clear criteria for when to split or merge intents. For instance, differentiate ""confirm_solution"" (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"") from ""express_gratitude"" based on the action or confirmation involved.

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents. For instance, distinguish ""report_payment_failure"" (""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (""Did you receive any error message?"") with context on the inquiry.

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing intents like ""accept_solution"" (""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (""Please for all future orders."") to ensure clarity.

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Train the model to understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents. For example, differentiate ""describe_issue"" (""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" by analyzing the surrounding context.

By following these guidelines, improve the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.3875018203734508,0.7008092715723595,0.3928571428571429,0.2715648684688814,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

11,feedback_1,"### Refined Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This involves tagging each response with a specific intent label to effectively guide the conversation. Follow these enhanced instructions for precise intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Define each intent clearly and provide examples to prevent confusion. For instance, differentiate between ""confirm_update"" and ""confirm_overcharge"" with examples such as ""Done, your profile has been updated"" for ""confirm_update"" and ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" for ""confirm_overcharge.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For example, consistently tag ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as ""close_conversation"" to avoid splitting into ""end_request"" or ""close_conversation"" based on minor wording variations.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how context can alter a message's intent. For instance, differentiate ""I’ll try PayPal"" as ""agree_to_try"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" as ""acknowledge,"" using context to guide intent recognition.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid unnecessary granularity unless it aligns with business objectives. For example, decide when to split intents like ""provide_instructions"" and ""provide_guidance"" based on their business significance.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Offer detailed examples of false merges to clarify intent distinctions. For instance, distinguish ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address"" as ""request_update_address"" from ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield"" as ""provide_new_address.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Group intents based on broader goals. Ensure all phrases aiming to close a conversation are tagged under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of wording differences.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Suggest strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as using previous interactions to differentiate intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation."" Clarify when ""No, that’s everything"" should be an ""end_request"" versus ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include diverse examples, particularly from error cases, to guide correct categorization. Differentiate intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by considering scenarios where context determines the intent, such as offering a refund versus suggesting a fix.

By applying these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and consistency of intent identification in customer service interactions, enhancing the overall customer experience.",3.0,,,0.4928677186328189,0.9332563213964832,0.4065040650406503,0.4599719140263414,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",,,,0.3989429219702807,0.7985149308618041,0.4351145038167939,0.3185618797549048,"[73.  7. 32. 84. 21. 33. 48.  2. 20. 39. 19. 69.  8. 31. 84. 40. 44.  1.

2,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on merging intents that serve similar functions. For example, combine ""acknowledge_and_thank"" with ""express_gratitude"" unless there are explicit reasons to keep them separate. Use examples such as ""customer: Okay, I’ll do that now. Thanks for your support!"" and ""customer: Perfect, thank you for the help."" to illustrate this consolidation.

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases to avoid false splits. For instance, ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be tagged as ""accept_solution."" Use these phrases to demonstrate the importance of consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how conversation context can alter intent interpretation. For example, ""Okay, let me check."" can imply ""acknowledge"" or ""accept_solution"" depending on preceding messages. Use examples like ""customer: That would be good."" and ""customer: Oh, I didn’t realize."" to show context's impact on intent.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions unless necessary for business objectives. Illustrate this by addressing errors such as tagging ""provide_refund_timeline"" and ""provide_instructions"" separately without clear differentiation.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to show how context alters intent, preventing false merges. For instance, differentiate ""customer: Awesome, appreciate the help!"" from ""customer: Perfect, thank you."" as ""express_gratitude"" and ""accept_solution"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their overarching goal. For example, all phrases related to closing should fall under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of specific wording. Use examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" to emphasize this point.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as analyzing the conversation stage or prior interactions. For example, differentiate between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation"" based on whether further action is implied.

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a wider range of examples to cover common pitfalls. For instance, differentiate ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_overcharge"" with scenarios like ""customer: I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.3180827175924228,0.7218621463737009,0.2480286738351254,0.229611873245646,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they appear in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""close_conversation"".

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" fall under ""acknowledge"" or if they indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" as ""provide_order_number"" if they respond to a request for an order number.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they serve a dual purpose.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.3768676215114094,0.681635416368167,0.4010791366906475,0.2568863181046104,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on when to merge intents and when to keep them distinct. Combine intents that express similar functions, such as gratitude or closure, unless the context significantly changes their meaning. For example, merge ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help!"" under ""close_conversation"".

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases by using specific examples. For instance, ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both be tagged as ""express_gratitude"". Highlight these to stress the importance of uniformity in tagging similar expressions.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Clearly illustrate how context can change intent interpretation. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" could mean ""provide_order_number"" if followed by order-related queries. Use such examples to show how preceding messages can shift intent, preventing errors like false merges.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions that do not serve a clear business purpose. For example, differentiate between ""provide_item_details"" and ""describe_error_message"" only when necessary. Ensure clarity in examples like ""Yes, it says my password is incorrect."" versus ""A carton of milk."" to prevent incorrect merges.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to illustrate how seemingly similar intents may require separation. For example, do not merge ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s FREEDELIVERY."" as they represent ""provide_order_number"" and ""provide_voucher_code"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their ultimate goal, such as merging all closing phrases under ""close_conversation"". This prevents false splits seen in examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""You’re very welcome!"", which should be unified under a single intent.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer practical strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation stage or examining previous interactions. For example, differentiate intents like ""confirm_refund"" and ""provide_payment_method"" based on context, seen in ""Refund has been processed."" versus ""With a credit card.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a broader range of examples that capture common pitfalls. Differentiate between ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" using scenarios such as ""I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential errors.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.6268253842488088,0.9031630258115054,0.6115288220551379,0.5661255106936137,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they follow a gratitude expression in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""express_gratitude"" unless used to conclude the exchange.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" are acknowledgments or indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context and surrounding conversation.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" as ""provide_order_number"" only if it responds to a request for an order number. Ensure that context is considered in scenarios where intent might be ambiguous.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they are part of a dual-purpose exchange.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.4376941079486332,0.7372108438517107,0.4864341085271318,0.3226728426697336,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_0,"Categorize each interaction between a customer and an assistant by examining both the wording and the context to determine the true intent or purpose of the message. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Recognize when messages should be grouped under a single intent versus when they should be split. Variations in phrasing do not indicate different intents if the underlying purpose is the same. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" both serve the intent of ""close_conversation"".

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Focus on the specific issue or action being described, rather than general similarities. Identify unique aspects of the message content that signal different intents, such as distinguishing between ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Identify common phrases that share the same intent despite appearing different. For example, ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" and ""Got it, thanks."" both express ""express_gratitude"".

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual cues to identify the broader intent, such as offering further assistance or closing the conversation. Messages like ""Happy to help! Anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both offer ""offer_additional_help"".

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Recognize that complex interactions may involve multiple distinct intents. Break down messages to discern different stages or aspects of the conversation, such as distinguishing ""report_problem"" from ""confirm_attempted_solution"".

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Look for specific problem descriptions that differentiate intents, even when they seem related. For example, ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."" and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be separate as ""describe_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

By following these guidelines, you can accurately categorize each interaction to improve the clustering accuracy of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3309779514644528,0.7885051456480029,0.3107569721115538,0.260977817825756,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

5,feedback_0,"Classify the given text into one of the predefined categories based on its intended outcome. 

**Guidelines:**
1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate similar intents. For example, phrases like ""You're welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should be grouped under ""close_conversation,"" whereas ""Thank you"" belongs to ""express_gratitude.""
   
2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Focus on the distinct action or response expected. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" should be categorized as ""confirm_update,"" while ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" falls under ""confirm_overcharge.""

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Look for keywords indicating a question (e.g., ""Could you,"" ""Can you"") versus a statement (e.g., ""You can,"" ""It is possible"") to differentiate intents like ""ask_new_address"" and ""provide_guidance.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Recognize that different phrasings can map to the same intent. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" both belong to ""close_conversation.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Consider the context and the action or reassurance being communicated. For example, ""Yes, you’ll receive an email"" should be ""confirm_process,"" while ""If you don’t see the email"" should be ""give_tip.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Identify the primary action or request. For example, ""Got it. Do you want to apply this change"" is a request for confirmation, while ""Hi, I can’t track my order"" indicates a request for assistance.

6,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

7,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts. Ensure accurate clustering by considering the following:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" with examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Differentiate between similar intents by recognizing nuances, such as ""confirm_issue"" (e.g., ""Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed."") versus ""acknowledge"" (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."").

3. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:** Consider the context in which a message is sent. For example, distinguish between requesting information (""Can you share the order number with me?"") and confirming a solution (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"").

4. **Standardize Intent Definitions:** Use consistent definitions for each intent, such as ""express_gratitude,"" with examples like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Perfect, thank you for the help.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Phrasing:** Recognize solution-related intents despite varied phrasing, such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues:** Distinguish between similar closing phrases using context and speaker roles, such as ""Have a great day."" (closing conversation) versus ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (ending a request).

8,feedback_1,"Determine the true intent or purpose of each interaction between a customer and an assistant by analyzing both the wording and context. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Group messages with the same underlying purpose, regardless of phrasing differences. For example, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" share the ""close_conversation"" intent. Focus on the core purpose behind the wording.

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Examine the specific content and action described to identify distinct intents, even for similar messages. Differentiate between intents like ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" by determining if the goal is to clarify a general issue or request specific information.

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Recognize phrases that, despite different wording, share the same intent. For instance, ""Okay, let me check."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both indicate ""acknowledge"" and should be grouped under this intent.

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to understand broader intents, such as concluding an interaction or offering further help. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Take care!"" both indicate a ""close_conversation"" intent.

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Break down complex interactions into multiple intents. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be separated into ""apologize"" and ""ask_order_number"" to reflect different conversation stages.

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Focus on specific details that separate intents, even if they seem related. Distinguish between ""confirm_update"" and ""provide_order_number"" by identifying the specific action or information being confirmed or provided.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Differentiate between intents with distinct purposes using contextual cues. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account."" should be categorized under ""offer_solution"" as they both involve problem-solving actions.

2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Identify unique actions to prevent incorrect merging of intents. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" is ""confirm_update,"" while ""I’ll try PayPal"" involves ""agree_to_try,"" reflecting different intents.

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Use specific keywords or phrases to distinguish inquiries from guidance. For example, ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" is ""reassure_customer,"" while ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" is ""provide_instructions.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Group expressions with similar sentiments under the same intent. For instance, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should be categorized as ""offer_additional_help.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Recognize the context and intent behind each message. For example, ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should be ""provide_refund_timeline,"" while ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" should be ""reassure_customer.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Focus on the primary action or request in the message. For example, ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card"" is a ""report_problem,"" and ""Hi, I can’t track my order in the app"" is a ""report_tracking_issue.""

10,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction by analyzing the context and action taken.

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group expressions conveying similar sentiments under a unified intent. For example, map ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide guidance to distinguish between actions with different intents. For example, use `ask_new_address` for ""Could you provide me with the new address?"" and `ask_payment_method` for ""Was this with a credit card or PayPal?"".

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Promote precise intent identification even when messages seem similar. Classify ""Okay, let me check."" as `acknowledge` and ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. Classify ""Perfect, thank you for the help."" as `express_gratitude`, while ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be labeled as `acknowledge`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for dealing with messages containing multiple intents, ensuring each intent is identified. For instance, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure messages with similar outcomes are consistently labeled. For example, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual information to disambiguate similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify intent definitions to avoid overlaps and ensure distinct categorization. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation`, while ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be `end_request`.

9. **Reinforce the Importance of Contextual Understanding:** Emphasize understanding the conversation context to accurately assign intents. For instance, distinguish between ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order."" as `report_billing_issue` and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" as `report_payment_failure`.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize grouping similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" to avoid false splits. For example, phrases like ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" and ""You too! Take care."" should consistently be categorized together.

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Highlight specific language cues to differentiate between similar intents. For instance, distinguish ""ask_clarification"" (""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"") from ""request_order_number"" (""Can you share the order number with me?"").

1,warm_start,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

By following these guidelines, ensure accurate and consistent classification of customer support messages based on their true intents.",,,,0.5220225073971582,0.8842336482615645,0.5127582017010935,0.4615898661904387,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

2,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Use clear examples to illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent to avoid false splits. For instance, ensure phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" are consistently categorized under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Similar Intents:** Provide detailed examples to distinguish closely related intents. Differentiate between ""ask_voucher_code"" and ""ask_order_number"" with specific language cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Reinforce the importance of understanding the conversation context to correctly identify intents. Recognize intents like ""diagnose_issue"" versus ""offer_compensation"" by understanding the broader service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear and consistent examples for each intent to prevent confusion. Ensure phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are always classified as ""acknowledge.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Offer guidance on identifying solution-related intents, ensuring different phrasings are recognized under the same intent. For example, both ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll manually add the points to your account now"" should be categorized under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of context and speaker roles to distinguish similar closing phrases and intents. Differentiate between ""close_conversation"" and ""end_request"" by examining the speaker and context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for more granular categorization, especially in broader intent categories. Provide examples of sub-intents, such as distinguishing ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3627834722431216,0.7128959682418796,0.3486943164362518,0.2586268747069112,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly differentiate between intents with similar functions. For example, distinguish between `ask_error_details` (""Sorry to hear that! Are you getting an error message?"") and `request_receipt_number` (""Can you share your receipt number?"").

2. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle differences in context or phrasing to accurately classify intents. For example, differentiate between `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") and `acknowledge` (""Got it, thanks."").

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Use consistent labels for messages leading to the same outcome. For instance, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome"" should be classified as `close_conversation`.

4. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents in a single message. For example, ""You’re welcome. I’ll keep tracking your order until it’s delivered,"" should include both `express_gratitude` and `confirm_followup`.

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to avoid false splits. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should map to `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. For instance, distinguish ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`) from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`).

7. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate intents that might seem similar. For example, separate `ask_new_address` from `report_voucher_issue` to avoid misclassification.

8. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Clarify and redefine overlapping intents to improve accuracy. For example, separate `end_request` (""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"") from `close_conversation` (""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."").

4,feedback_1,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent with examples. For instance, categorize phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" consistently under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Clarify Intent Distinctions with Examples:** Use specific examples to highlight subtle differences between closely related intents. Differentiate ""ask_voucher_code"" from ""ask_order_number"" with cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Stress the importance of understanding the broader conversation context to accurately identify intents. For example, distinguish ""diagnose_issue"" from ""offer_compensation"" by recognizing the specific service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear examples to ensure consistent intent classification. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" should always be classified under ""acknowledge,"" while ""Perfect, thank you"" should be under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Guide the recognition of solution-related intents by categorizing different phrasings under the same intent. For instance, ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" should fall under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of speaker roles and context to distinguish similar closing phrases. Differentiate ""close_conversation"" from ""end_request"" by identifying whether the speaker is the customer or assistant and examining the conversation context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for granular categorization within broader intents. Distinguish ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank"" by recognizing when gratitude is expressed standalone versus when it accompanies acknowledgment of a solution.

8. **Encourage Use of Speaker Context:** Stress the importance of identifying the speaker (customer or assistant) to accurately classify intents, particularly in mixed dialogues. This helps avoid errors like merging intents that belong to different roles, such as ""describe_issue"" and ""confirm_overcharge.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages for improved intent discovery and reduced errors.",0.0,,,0.3392932480499438,0.6273454689869914,0.2936630602782071,0.2128540818220116,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly define and differentiate between intents with similar functions. For instance, distinguish between `acknowledge` (""Okay, let me check."") and `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") to avoid confusion and ensure precise clustering.

2. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents within a single message. For example, in ""No worries, resetting usually solves this problem. Would you like me to guide you through it?"", recognize both `offer_solution` and `offer_assistance`.

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Ensure that similar messages consistently lead to the same intent label. For example, both ""Appreciate the help!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should be labeled as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle contextual differences to enhance precision in intent classification. Distinguish between `report_problem` (""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."") and `report_login_issue` (""Hi, I can’t log in to the app anymore."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to prevent false splits. Ensure that ""Much appreciated!"" and ""Thanks, that works."" are categorized under `express_gratitude`.

6. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate overlapping intents. For instance, clearly separate `request_update_address` from `report_forgot_password` to avoid misclassification.

7. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Provide distinct definitions for overlapping intent categories to enhance classification accuracy. For example, differentiate between `provide_refund_timeline` and `explain_reason` for refund-related messages.

8. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. Distinguish between ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`) and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`).

9. **Incorporate Disambiguation Cues:** Add cues or examples to help distinguish often-confused intents. Differentiate between `offer_additional_help` (""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"") and `offer_solution` (""Would you like me to issue you a different voucher?"") using scenario-based examples.

3,feedback_0,"When assigning a label to each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Recognize messages that share the same intent despite different expressions, while also distinguishing messages with distinct purposes. Use context and the flow of conversation to guide your labeling decisions. 

- **Identify Similar Intents**: Look for messages that express the same intent using different words (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both convey 'acknowledge'). Group these under the same intent.

- **Emphasize Granularity**: Analyze the specific actions or information conveyed. Differentiate messages that appear related but serve different functions (e.g., ""Open the app, tap “Forgot password”, and follow the steps."" vs. ""It was SAVE20."").

- **Differentiate Actions**: Recognize messages with distinct actions or outcomes (e.g., ""I’ve added a $10 voucher to your account."" vs. ""Done. The points are now visible in your balance."") and label them separately.

- **Use Contextual Cues**: Consider the context and conversational flow to determine the intent (e.g., ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" both function as 'close_conversation').

- **Distinguish Similar Responses**: Differentiate between responses with similar wording but different intents (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" vs. ""That’s helpful, thanks!"") by considering their function.

- **Create Comprehensive Labels**: Develop labels that capture both the action and context of the message, ensuring specificity and descriptiveness (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."" needs a distinct label from ""A carton of milk."").

- **Balance Specificity and Generalization**: Find a balance in label specificity. Use broader categories when appropriate, but maintain specificity when messages have distinct intents (e.g., ""I see. What voucher code are you trying to use?"" vs. ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"").

By following these guidelines, you'll improve your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, enhancing the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.2866114621833696,0.824207215844252,0.2334455667789001,0.2362272352752052,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"Classify each input according to the following refined list of intents, taking into account the context and the role of the speaker (customer vs. assistant). Pay special attention to distinguishing between closely related intents and understanding the nuances of each category:

1. **report_wrong_order**: Identifying issues with a received order.
2. **report_missing_receipt**: Notifying about the absence of a receipt.
3. **suggest_troubleshooting**: Offering solutions to resolve an issue.
4. **acknowledge**: Recognizing or validating a statement or concern. Note that acknowledgment may coexist with gratitude but should be identified as distinct when acknowledging an action or solution.
5. **explain_reason**: Providing explanations for a situation or decision.
6. **describe_issue**: Detailing a specific problem or concern.
7. **request_replacement**: Asking for a new item in place of a faulty one.
8. **express_gratitude**: Thanking or showing appreciation. Differentiate from accepting solutions or closing conversations when gratitude is the primary intent.
9. **provide_order_number**: Supplying a reference or order number.
10. **close_conversation**: Ending the interaction. Identify when this overlaps with gratitude or other intents and determine which is predominant.
11. **accept_solution**: Agreeing to a proposed resolution. Distinguish from mere expressions of satisfaction or gratitude.
12. **offer_compensation**: Proposing a benefit as reparation.
13. **confirm_action**: Verifying that a task has been completed. Differentiate from offering solutions or confirming follow-ups.
14. **offer_discount**: Providing a price reduction as a goodwill gesture.
15. **confirm_followup**: Assuring ongoing tracking or future actions. Differentiate from confirming immediate actions.
16. **ask_payment_method**: Inquiring about the payment type used.
17. **ask_new_timeslot**: Requesting a preferred time for scheduling.
18. **provide_guidance**: Giving instructions or advice on how to proceed. Differentiate when both suggesting alternatives and providing guidance are involved.

Consider the intent's predominant purpose, context, and speaker role, ensuring that similar intents are grouped and differentiated accurately. Use examples to guide the classification, highlight common pitfalls, and provide corrective examples to avoid errors such as false splits and merges in intent classification.",0.0,,,0.3206978324821099,0.4225476791566757,0.2803418803418804,0.1355101248258919,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"When labeling each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by carefully examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Here are key guidelines to assist in accurate intent discovery:

1. **Clarify Intent Identification**:
   - Identify messages that convey the same intent despite different expressions (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be labeled as 'accept_solution'). Emphasize recognizing varied phrasing for similar intents.

2. **Enhance Differentiation of Actions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between messages with different actions or outcomes (e.g., ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."" should be labeled 'report_problem', while ""Yes, I tried both. Still doesn't work."" should be 'confirm_attempted_solution').

3. **Highlight the Need for Granularity**:
   - Focus on specific actions or outcomes in messages (e.g., ""You’re very welcome! Let me know if you need more help after resetting."" should be 'offer_followup' and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be 'end_request').

4. **Encourage Contextual Analysis**:
   - Use context and conversation flow to determine intent (e.g., ""I understand, that must be frustrating. Have you tried rescanning it or adding it to the app?"" should be 'suggest_troubleshooting', and ""Thanks. That code is only valid for orders above $50."" should be 'explain_restriction').

5. **Improve Label Specificity**:
   - Create labels that encapsulate both the action and context (e.g., ""Done, your profile has been updated."" should have a distinct label from ""Got it. I’ve updated your delivery slot to 6–8 pm."" by considering the specific updates being confirmed).

6. **Balance Specificity and Generalization**:
   - Find a balance between broad and specific categories (e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Thanks, that works."" should consistently be labeled as 'express_gratitude' to avoid false splits).

7. **Distinguish Function in Similar Responses**:
   - Differentiate responses with similar wording but different functions (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" should be labeled 'accept_solution', while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be 'express_gratitude', based on their contextual function).

By integrating these guidelines, you'll enhance your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, improving the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.3597713988131546,0.688632331720567,0.3021690351533284,0.2477502172510727,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

   - ""express_gratitude"": Expressions of thankfulness (e.g., ""Thank you so much!"")

2. **Provide Examples for Disambiguation**: Use examples to distinguish intents:
   - ""Okay, thanks for checking."" (acknowledge)
   - ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" (express_gratitude)

3. **Emphasize Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to distinguish intents, especially in assistant messages:
   - ""close_conversation"": When the conversation is ending (e.g., ""Take care!"")
   - ""offer_additional_help"": When further assistance is offered (e.g., ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"")

4. **Reinforce Intent Consistency**: Maintain consistent categorization for similar intents to avoid splits:
   - ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" should consistently be categorized under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Highlight Specificity in Instructions**: Be specific when categorizing requests or instructions:
   - ""request_order_number"": Specific request for the order number (e.g., ""Can you share the order number with me?"")
   - ""ask_order_number"": General inquiry for the order number (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"")

6. **Encourage Flexibility in Interpretation**: Allow flexibility for variations in phrasing to ensure accurate categorization:
   - ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" may accommodate slight variations in phrasing while maintaining their distinct categories.

7. **Include Common Closing Phrases**: Group common closing phrases under ""close_conversation"" for consistent classification:
   - Examples include ""Thank you for reaching out!"" and ""Have a great day!""

8. **Provide More Contextual Scenarios**: Expand on typical conversation flows to illustrate how intents may transition or overlap:
   - For example, moving from ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the interaction concludes.

10,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between intents such as ""request_order_number"" (where a customer is explicitly asking for their order number) and ""ask_order_number"" (where a customer might be inquiring if they need to provide their order number).

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Recognize that similar phrases often share the same intent. For example, phrases like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation."" Maintain consistency across similar expressions.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Understand that different phrases can convey the same intent. For instance, ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should both be categorized under the ""acknowledge"" intent.

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use contextual cues to distinguish between intents. For example, the intent behind ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (likely ""close_conversation"") differs from ""No, that’s all"" (possibly ""end_request"") based on conversation context.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Aim for a balanced level of granularity. Avoid overly detailed distinctions like ""request_order_number"" vs. ""ask_order_number"" unless necessary for specific business goals.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Use examples such as ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" to illustrate how similar queries can reflect different intents, such as ""apology"" versus ""request_order_number,"" depending on context and phrasing.

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents based on the underlying goal of the message. For instance, all forms of closing statements should be under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Implement strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.3808945168581792,0.7729468599033816,0.3720930232558139,0.2944112207599453,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

12,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group expressions that close a conversation together, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from standalone expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me.""

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Differentiate between gratitude and confirmation. For example, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be seen as a ""confirm_solution"" followed by ""express_gratitude,"" whereas ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" primarily expresses gratitude.

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Maintain consistency in grouping similar acknowledgments. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped based on context unless differentiated by specific actions.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents are present within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" which offers help and seeks further engagement.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use conversation context to determine intents, such as classifying both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" under ""provide_order_number.""

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges, using examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to show when gratitude is a distinct intent.

13,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiate between closely related intents, and use consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Identify Similar Intents:**
   - Example: ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!"" both have the intent: close_conversation.

2. **Differentiate Close Intents:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" has the intent: express_gratitude, while ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge.

3. **Consistent Language Use:**
   - Use standardized terminology for similar requests, such as ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" both having the intent: request_order_number.

4. **Encourage Intent Grouping:**
   - Example: ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""assistant: Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both have the intent: offer_additional_help.

5. **Refine Acknowledgment vs. Gratitude:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge, while ""customer: Got it, thanks."" has the intent: express_gratitude.

6. **Disambiguate Instructional Content:**
   - Example: ""assistant: No worries. You can reset it by tapping “Forgot password” on the login screen."" and ""assistant: Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English."" both have the intent: provide_instructions.

7. **Highlight Intent Continuity:**
   - Example: ""customer: No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" and ""customer: No, that’s all."" both have the intent: end_request.

14,feedback_0,"Classify each statement as either ""customer"" or ""assistant"" and provide a corresponding intent label. 

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding or agreement, often with neutral responses.
   - Example: ""Okay, let me check.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases are often neutral confirmations, while gratitude phrases express thanks.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Cross-reference with other examples to ensure accurate intent classification.
- Incorporate a review step to prevent false merges of distinct intents.",6.0,,,0.2292799157896447,0.5185093167701863,0.1614906832298136,0.1188837724852145,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

15,feedback_0,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Below are guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Clearly differentiate between similar intents, such as:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without further action. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Examples: ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - For intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"", look for explicit gratitude terms to categorize as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Ensure uniformity in labeling similar responses. E.g., categorize both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Decide on a consistent approach for messages like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" Determine if they should be split into separate intents or fall under a broader category like ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For instance, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be marked as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically evaluate and adjust intent categories to ensure they align with evolving customer interaction trends.

8. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Provide specific instructions for phrases that may fit multiple intents. Use context cues to determine the most appropriate intent.

By following these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and clarity of intent categorization in customer service interactions.",7.0,,,0.3644745725009509,0.7728260869565217,0.3103448275862068,0.2816754576610609,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

4. **give_tip**: Identify suggestions or advice not directly instructing the user on a specific action, e.g., ""If you don’t see the email, please check your spam folder.""

5. **confirm_process**: Define this category for confirming a process will occur, without providing additional instructions, such as ""Your refund is being processed.""

7. **close_conversation**: Use this for messages that explicitly indicate the end of an interaction, whether or not they contain gratitude, like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **resolve_issue**: Consolidate statements related to solutions and timelines for resolving issues, such as ""The refund will be processed in 3-5 days"" and ""We can offer you a replacement.""

17,feedback_1,"Categorize each interaction based on its intent or action with the following guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Ensure similar expressions are consistently categorized under the same intent:
   - ""close_conversation"": Use for expressions that conclude the interaction (e.g., ""Glad I could help!"", ""You’re very welcome!"", ""Take care!"", ""Thank you for reaching out!"")

2. **Disambiguate Gratitude and Solution Confirmation**: Differentiate between gratitude and solution confirmation, even if they appear together:
   - ""confirm_solution"": Focus on verifying the solution worked (e.g., ""Yes, that worked."")
   - ""express_gratitude"": Focus on thankfulness (e.g., ""Thanks for your help!"")

3. **Utilize Contextual Cues for Assistants**: Identify the primary purpose of assistant messages through context:
   - ""provide_refund_timeline"": Specific information about refund timing (e.g., ""Your refund will be processed in 3-5 days."")
   - ""reassure_customer"": General reassurance without specific timelines (e.g., ""We’re here to help with any issues."")

4. **Maintain Consistent Categorization**: Ensure distinct intents remain separate:
   - ""ask_order_number"": Direct request for order details (e.g., ""Can you provide your order number?"")
   - ""reassure_customer"": Comforting messages (e.g., ""Don't worry, we’ll sort this out."")

5. **Expand Closing Intent Examples**: Include a variety of closing phrases under ""close_conversation"":
   - Examples: ""Have a great day!"", ""Talk to you soon!"", ""You're welcome, anytime!""

6. **Differentiate Between Requests and Instructions**: Clarify distinctions between requests and inquiries:
   - ""request_order_number"": Direct request (e.g., ""Please give me your order number."")
   - ""ask_order_number"": More general inquiry (e.g., ""Could I have your order number?"")

7. **Illustrate Overlapping Intents**: Provide scenarios where intents transition:
   - Example: From ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the dialogue wraps up.

8. **Prioritize Message Purpose**: Focus on the main intent when gratitude and confirmation coexist:
   - ""confirm_solution"": When the main purpose is verifying success (e.g., ""Yes, that's fixed. Thanks!"")

18,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.4430388052552682,0.9128787878787878,0.3555555555555555,0.4044407275246955,"[18. 22. 15.  4. 13.  2. 16.  9. 11.  7.  3. 21. 15.  8. 17.  0. 12.  9.

20,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

22,feedback_1,"Classify each statement as either ""customer"" or ""assistant"" and provide a corresponding intent label.

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding, agreement, or readiness to proceed.
   - Example: ""Okay, thanks for checking."" or ""Perfect, I’ll try that now.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

6. **Provide Refund Timeline**: Informing about the duration for processing a refund.
   - Example: ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days.""

7. **Request Order Number**: Asking the customer to provide their order number.
   - Example: ""Can you share the order number with me?""

8. **Confirm Issue**: Verifying or clarifying the problem or concern presented.
   - Example: ""So, the item was damaged on arrival?""

9. **Give Tip**: Offering helpful suggestions without detailed steps.
   - Example: ""It might help to restart your device.""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases can signal readiness to proceed or confirm understanding.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.
- Maintain separate intents for messages that convey different actions or requests, even if they appear in quick succession.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Encourage ongoing review and refinement based on new data or ambiguous cases.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for users to flag difficult-to-classify messages for further analysis and definition adjustment.",6.0,,,0.4699180112633404,0.5492063492063491,0.3855421686746987,0.2580819553922472,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

23,feedback_1,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Follow these refined guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Provide clear definitions to differentiate similar intents:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without explicit gratitude. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Strengthen differentiation cues for intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"". Explicit gratitude terms such as ""thanks"" or ""appreciate"" should be categorized as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Maintain uniformity in labeling similar responses. For instance, both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should be labeled as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Provide clear instructions for messages with multiple intents. Decide whether to split into separate intents or choose a primary one, e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" could be split into ""Acknowledge"" and ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between overlapping intents like ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For example, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be categorized as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Use context to interpret ambiguous phrases, ensuring specificity. For instance, differentiate ""offer_alternative_updates"" from ""explain_issue"" by context in messages like ""I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives.""

8. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Emphasize the importance of regularly updating intent categories to reflect changes in customer interaction patterns, minimizing errors like ""false_merge"" and ""false_split"".

9. **Illustrate with Error Examples:**
   - Use specific examples to illustrate common mistakes and corrections. For instance, separate ""Great, how long will the refund take?"" from ""ask_order_number"" to clarify distinct intents.

By implementing these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and consistency of intent categorization in customer service interactions.",7.0,,,0.3406907170441308,0.6316205533596838,0.2972972972972973,0.2151872592239213,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

0,warm_start,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiating between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some refined guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:**
   - Example: Differentiate ""assistant: Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed."" (intent: confirm_issue) from ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" (intent: acknowledge).

2. **Avoid False Merges:**
   - Example: Distinguish ""customer: That’s helpful, thanks!"" (intent: express_gratitude) from ""customer: Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" (intent: confirm_solution).

3. **Standardize Instructional Language:**
   - Example: Separate ""assistant: If you don’t see the email, please check your spam folder."" (intent: give_tip) from ""assistant: I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives."" (intent: offer_alternative_updates).

4. **Consistent Recognition of Similar Intents:**
   - Example: Ensure consistency in labeling ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" as (intent: close_conversation).

5. **Refine Request Differentiation:**
   - Example: Use consistent labeling for ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" as (intent: request_order_number).

6. **Disambiguate Similar Yet Distinct Intents:**
   - Example: Differentiate ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" (intent: offer_additional_help) from ""assistant: I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives."" (intent: offer_alternative_updates).

7. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Example: Understand context to differentiate ""offer_additional_help"" from ""give_tip,"" ensuring accurate capture of message purposes.

8. **Reinforce Intent Consistency:**
   - Example: Maintain consistent labeling for intents such as ""close_conversation,"" even with slight phrasings like ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!""

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

3,warm_start,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",,,,0.5226651228327732,0.9039226080042408,0.4666666666666667,0.4724488209438572,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

4,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiating between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some refined guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Enhance Recognition of Similar Phrasings for Consistent Intents:**
   - Consistently label expressions of gratitude such as ""Okay, thanks for the advice,"" ""Got it, thanks,"" and ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" as (intent: express_gratitude).

2. **Differentiate Closely Related Intents:**
   - Emphasize recognizing specific actions or agreements to differentiate intents like ""provide_payment_method"" and ""agree_to_try."" For example, distinguish ""With a credit card"" from ""I’ll try PayPal.""

3. **Clarify Intent Boundaries for Endings and Closures:**
   - Reinforce the difference between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation,"" distinguishing messages like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" from ""Great. Have a wonderful day!""

4. **Use Consistent Terminology for Similar Actions:**
   - Standardize intent labels like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" as (intent: offer_solution).

5. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Highlight the importance of context to differentiate similar intents like ""offer_additional_help"" and ""offer_alternative_updates.""

6. **Standardize Language for Common Requests:**
   - Use consistent intent labeling for requests such as ""request_order_number"" by recognizing similar phrasing.

7. **Reinforce Consistency in Closing Statements:**
   - Ensure that intents like ""close_conversation"" are consistently applied to varied phrasings like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **Disambiguate Errors and Solutions:**
   - Clarify the separation between describing an error and agreeing to a solution, as seen in messages like ""Yes, it said 'transaction declined'"" and ""I’ll try PayPal.""

By focusing on these areas, the intent discovery process can produce more accurate and meaningful clusters, reducing instances of both false splits and merges.",0.0,,,0.4251179299910477,0.6839569160997733,0.448,0.2907623483753963,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

5,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Stress the importance of distinguishing between expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" and standalone gratitude expressions like ""Thank you for helping me,"" unless part of a closing dialogue.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide examples to differentiate similar intents like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be primarily labeled as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Emphasize consistency when clustering acknowledgments. Use context to decide if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped together or separately, depending on the specific action each acknowledgment implies.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Illustrate when multiple intents are present in a single message. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should encompass both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance.""

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Encourage using the surrounding conversation context to accurately determine intents. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number"" based on the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

By adhering to these guidelines, ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing the likelihood of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.5866176001462057,0.9064625850340136,0.6375,0.5317469062549789,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

6,feedback_0,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content. 

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly distinguish intents such as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude."" Use ""close_conversation"" for messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" which aim to conclude an interaction.

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Provide distinct categories for similar intents. For instance, separate ""ask_order_number"" (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"") as they seek different information.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Ensure all expressions of thanks are consistently categorized under ""express_gratitude,"" such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use context to differentiate similar intents like ""provide_new_address"" (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."") from ""provide_guidance"" (e.g., ""If the card still fails later, contact your bank for details."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Specify when to split or merge intents based on differences, such as separating ""confirm_action"" (e.g., ""I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent."") from ""confirm_overcharge"" (e.g., ""You were indeed charged twice for delivery."").

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents like ""report_payment_failure"" (e.g., ""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"").

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing ""accept_solution"" (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders."").

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents, such as differentiating ""describe_issue"" (e.g., ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders.""). 

By following these guidelines, enhance the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.4532005658934174,0.8261070526695526,0.4508196721311475,0.3743921837583844,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

7,feedback_0,"### Improved Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",3.0,,,0.7327216376763207,0.9560090702947844,0.7560975609756097,0.7004885316198113,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

8,feedback_1,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, accurately identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, clearly distinguishing between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are refined guidelines and examples to assist you:

1. **Consistent Recognition for Acknowledgment:**
   - Ensure that acknowledgment expressions like ""Perfect, I’ll try that now,"" ""Okay, let me check,"" and ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are consistently labeled as (intent: acknowledge).

2. **Differentiate Information Requests and Solution Offers:**
   - Clearly differentiate intents such as ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" from ""offer_solution."" For example, distinguish ""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"" from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

3. **Refine Problem Reporting vs. Update Requests:**
   - Precisely differentiate intents like ""report_billing_issue"" from ""request_update_address."" For instance, distinguish ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" from ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address.""

4. **Standardize Intent Labeling for Similar Actions:**
   - Recognize similar phrasing for actions like ""offer_solution,"" such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account.""

5. **Clarify Boundaries for Similar Requests:**
   - Reinforce differentiation between similar intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"" with clear examples, such as ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" versus ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

6. **Disambiguate Confirming Actions vs. Reassuring Customers:**
   - Highlight the difference between ""confirm_action"" and ""reassure_customer."" For example, differentiate ""Perfect, I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent to your address"" from ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot.""

7. **Standardize Language for Gratitude and Closures:**
   - Consistently apply intent labels like ""close_conversation"" to varied phrasings such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!""

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding for Similar Intents:**
   - Emphasize context to distinguish similar intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""explain_issue."" For instance, contrast ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" with ""Thank you. I see the order is on its way, but the tracking system is delayed.""

9,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Evaluate the role of each message in the conversation to correctly identify its intent. For example, in a billing issue context, ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" should be understood as ""offer_solution.""

- **Refine Instructions for Distinguishing Closing Statements:** Differentiate between expressions that close a conversation and those that offer gratitude. For instance, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" should be categorized as ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s everything"" should be recognized as ""end_request.""

- **Improve Differentiation of Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples to distinguish similar intents, such as ""provide_refund_timeline"" versus general refund information. Statements like ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should fall under ""provide_refund_timeline.""

- **Incorporate Examples for Disambiguating Instructions and Solutions:** Use examples like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" for ""offer_solution"" and ""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen"" for ""provide_instructions.""

- **Highlight the Need for Consistent Acknowledgment Clustering:** Use context to decide whether acknowledgment phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" should be combined into a single intent or kept separate.

- **Address Multi-Intent Messages Clearly:** Illustrate how to handle messages with multiple intents. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" should be recognized as ""offer_solution"" and potentially involve other intents depending on the broader query.

- **Provide Clear Guidelines for Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents exist within a single message and classify them accurately without false merges.

- **Include Examples of Gratitude as a Distinct Intent:** Demonstrate situations where gratitude should be a standalone intent, such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" to prevent incorrect merges with other intents.

By implementing these guidelines, ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing the likelihood of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.2833505640445911,0.8491842624495686,0.2005277044854881,0.2406168397428753,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

10,feedback_1,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content.

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly define each intent with examples. Use ""close_conversation"" for statements intended to end an interaction, such as ""Have a great day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Differentiate from ""express_gratitude,"" which includes expressions like ""Thank you for the help.""

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Create distinct categories for intents that are contextually different. For example, ""request_order_number"" involves asking for an order number, such as ""Can you share the order number with me?"" while ""ask_order_number"" might be used in different contexts.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Group similar expressions under the same intent consistently. For instance, all expressions of gratitude, including ""Perfect, thank you for the help,"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate between similar intents. For example, distinguish ""provide_instructions"" (""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen."") from ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by the nature of the message.

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Provide clear criteria for when to split or merge intents. For instance, differentiate ""confirm_solution"" (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"") from ""express_gratitude"" based on the action or confirmation involved.

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents. For instance, distinguish ""report_payment_failure"" (""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (""Did you receive any error message?"") with context on the inquiry.

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing intents like ""accept_solution"" (""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (""Please for all future orders."") to ensure clarity.

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Train the model to understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents. For example, differentiate ""describe_issue"" (""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" by analyzing the surrounding context.

By following these guidelines, improve the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.3875018203734508,0.7008092715723595,0.3928571428571429,0.2715648684688814,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

11,feedback_1,"### Refined Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This involves tagging each response with a specific intent label to effectively guide the conversation. Follow these enhanced instructions for precise intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Define each intent clearly and provide examples to prevent confusion. For instance, differentiate between ""confirm_update"" and ""confirm_overcharge"" with examples such as ""Done, your profile has been updated"" for ""confirm_update"" and ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" for ""confirm_overcharge.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For example, consistently tag ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as ""close_conversation"" to avoid splitting into ""end_request"" or ""close_conversation"" based on minor wording variations.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how context can alter a message's intent. For instance, differentiate ""I’ll try PayPal"" as ""agree_to_try"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" as ""acknowledge,"" using context to guide intent recognition.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid unnecessary granularity unless it aligns with business objectives. For example, decide when to split intents like ""provide_instructions"" and ""provide_guidance"" based on their business significance.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Offer detailed examples of false merges to clarify intent distinctions. For instance, distinguish ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address"" as ""request_update_address"" from ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield"" as ""provide_new_address.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Group intents based on broader goals. Ensure all phrases aiming to close a conversation are tagged under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of wording differences.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Suggest strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as using previous interactions to differentiate intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation."" Clarify when ""No, that’s everything"" should be an ""end_request"" versus ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include diverse examples, particularly from error cases, to guide correct categorization. Differentiate intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by considering scenarios where context determines the intent, such as offering a refund versus suggesting a fix.

By applying these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and consistency of intent identification in customer service interactions, enhancing the overall customer experience.",3.0,,,0.4928677186328189,0.9332563213964832,0.4065040650406503,0.4599719140263414,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",,,,0.6402509353401891,0.922481612966042,0.6461538461538462,0.5906197155356346,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",,,,0.3989429219702807,0.7985149308618041,0.4351145038167939,0.3185618797549048,"[73.  7. 32. 84. 21. 33. 48.  2. 20. 39. 19. 69.  8. 31. 84. 40. 44.  1.

2,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on merging intents that serve similar functions. For example, combine ""acknowledge_and_thank"" with ""express_gratitude"" unless there are explicit reasons to keep them separate. Use examples such as ""customer: Okay, I’ll do that now. Thanks for your support!"" and ""customer: Perfect, thank you for the help."" to illustrate this consolidation.

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases to avoid false splits. For instance, ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be tagged as ""accept_solution."" Use these phrases to demonstrate the importance of consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how conversation context can alter intent interpretation. For example, ""Okay, let me check."" can imply ""acknowledge"" or ""accept_solution"" depending on preceding messages. Use examples like ""customer: That would be good."" and ""customer: Oh, I didn’t realize."" to show context's impact on intent.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions unless necessary for business objectives. Illustrate this by addressing errors such as tagging ""provide_refund_timeline"" and ""provide_instructions"" separately without clear differentiation.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to show how context alters intent, preventing false merges. For instance, differentiate ""customer: Awesome, appreciate the help!"" from ""customer: Perfect, thank you."" as ""express_gratitude"" and ""accept_solution"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their overarching goal. For example, all phrases related to closing should fall under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of specific wording. Use examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" to emphasize this point.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as analyzing the conversation stage or prior interactions. For example, differentiate between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation"" based on whether further action is implied.

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a wider range of examples to cover common pitfalls. For instance, differentiate ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_overcharge"" with scenarios like ""customer: I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.3180827175924228,0.7218621463737009,0.2480286738351254,0.229611873245646,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they appear in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""close_conversation"".

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" fall under ""acknowledge"" or if they indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" as ""provide_order_number"" if they respond to a request for an order number.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they serve a dual purpose.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.3768676215114094,0.681635416368167,0.4010791366906475,0.2568863181046104,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on when to merge intents and when to keep them distinct. Combine intents that express similar functions, such as gratitude or closure, unless the context significantly changes their meaning. For example, merge ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help!"" under ""close_conversation"".

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases by using specific examples. For instance, ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both be tagged as ""express_gratitude"". Highlight these to stress the importance of uniformity in tagging similar expressions.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Clearly illustrate how context can change intent interpretation. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" could mean ""provide_order_number"" if followed by order-related queries. Use such examples to show how preceding messages can shift intent, preventing errors like false merges.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions that do not serve a clear business purpose. For example, differentiate between ""provide_item_details"" and ""describe_error_message"" only when necessary. Ensure clarity in examples like ""Yes, it says my password is incorrect."" versus ""A carton of milk."" to prevent incorrect merges.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to illustrate how seemingly similar intents may require separation. For example, do not merge ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s FREEDELIVERY."" as they represent ""provide_order_number"" and ""provide_voucher_code"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their ultimate goal, such as merging all closing phrases under ""close_conversation"". This prevents false splits seen in examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""You’re very welcome!"", which should be unified under a single intent.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer practical strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation stage or examining previous interactions. For example, differentiate intents like ""confirm_refund"" and ""provide_payment_method"" based on context, seen in ""Refund has been processed."" versus ""With a credit card.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a broader range of examples that capture common pitfalls. Differentiate between ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" using scenarios such as ""I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential errors.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.6268253842488088,0.9031630258115054,0.6115288220551379,0.5661255106936137,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they follow a gratitude expression in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""express_gratitude"" unless used to conclude the exchange.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" are acknowledgments or indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context and surrounding conversation.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" as ""provide_order_number"" only if it responds to a request for an order number. Ensure that context is considered in scenarios where intent might be ambiguous.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they are part of a dual-purpose exchange.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.4376941079486332,0.7372108438517107,0.4864341085271318,0.3226728426697336,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_0,"Categorize each interaction between a customer and an assistant by examining both the wording and the context to determine the true intent or purpose of the message. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Recognize when messages should be grouped under a single intent versus when they should be split. Variations in phrasing do not indicate different intents if the underlying purpose is the same. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" both serve the intent of ""close_conversation"".

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Focus on the specific issue or action being described, rather than general similarities. Identify unique aspects of the message content that signal different intents, such as distinguishing between ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Identify common phrases that share the same intent despite appearing different. For example, ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" and ""Got it, thanks."" both express ""express_gratitude"".

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual cues to identify the broader intent, such as offering further assistance or closing the conversation. Messages like ""Happy to help! Anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both offer ""offer_additional_help"".

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Recognize that complex interactions may involve multiple distinct intents. Break down messages to discern different stages or aspects of the conversation, such as distinguishing ""report_problem"" from ""confirm_attempted_solution"".

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Look for specific problem descriptions that differentiate intents, even when they seem related. For example, ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."" and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be separate as ""describe_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

By following these guidelines, you can accurately categorize each interaction to improve the clustering accuracy of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3309779514644528,0.7885051456480029,0.3107569721115538,0.260977817825756,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

5,feedback_0,"Classify the given text into one of the predefined categories based on its intended outcome. 

**Guidelines:**
1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate similar intents. For example, phrases like ""You're welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should be grouped under ""close_conversation,"" whereas ""Thank you"" belongs to ""express_gratitude.""
   
2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Focus on the distinct action or response expected. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" should be categorized as ""confirm_update,"" while ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" falls under ""confirm_overcharge.""

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Look for keywords indicating a question (e.g., ""Could you,"" ""Can you"") versus a statement (e.g., ""You can,"" ""It is possible"") to differentiate intents like ""ask_new_address"" and ""provide_guidance.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Recognize that different phrasings can map to the same intent. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" both belong to ""close_conversation.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Consider the context and the action or reassurance being communicated. For example, ""Yes, you’ll receive an email"" should be ""confirm_process,"" while ""If you don’t see the email"" should be ""give_tip.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Identify the primary action or request. For example, ""Got it. Do you want to apply this change"" is a request for confirmation, while ""Hi, I can’t track my order"" indicates a request for assistance.

6,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

7,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts. Ensure accurate clustering by considering the following:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" with examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Differentiate between similar intents by recognizing nuances, such as ""confirm_issue"" (e.g., ""Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed."") versus ""acknowledge"" (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."").

3. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:** Consider the context in which a message is sent. For example, distinguish between requesting information (""Can you share the order number with me?"") and confirming a solution (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"").

4. **Standardize Intent Definitions:** Use consistent definitions for each intent, such as ""express_gratitude,"" with examples like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Perfect, thank you for the help.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Phrasing:** Recognize solution-related intents despite varied phrasing, such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues:** Distinguish between similar closing phrases using context and speaker roles, such as ""Have a great day."" (closing conversation) versus ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (ending a request).

8,feedback_1,"Determine the true intent or purpose of each interaction between a customer and an assistant by analyzing both the wording and context. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Group messages with the same underlying purpose, regardless of phrasing differences. For example, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" share the ""close_conversation"" intent. Focus on the core purpose behind the wording.

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Examine the specific content and action described to identify distinct intents, even for similar messages. Differentiate between intents like ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" by determining if the goal is to clarify a general issue or request specific information.

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Recognize phrases that, despite different wording, share the same intent. For instance, ""Okay, let me check."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both indicate ""acknowledge"" and should be grouped under this intent.

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to understand broader intents, such as concluding an interaction or offering further help. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Take care!"" both indicate a ""close_conversation"" intent.

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Break down complex interactions into multiple intents. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be separated into ""apologize"" and ""ask_order_number"" to reflect different conversation stages.

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Focus on specific details that separate intents, even if they seem related. Distinguish between ""confirm_update"" and ""provide_order_number"" by identifying the specific action or information being confirmed or provided.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Differentiate between intents with distinct purposes using contextual cues. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account."" should be categorized under ""offer_solution"" as they both involve problem-solving actions.

2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Identify unique actions to prevent incorrect merging of intents. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" is ""confirm_update,"" while ""I’ll try PayPal"" involves ""agree_to_try,"" reflecting different intents.

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Use specific keywords or phrases to distinguish inquiries from guidance. For example, ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" is ""reassure_customer,"" while ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" is ""provide_instructions.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Group expressions with similar sentiments under the same intent. For instance, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should be categorized as ""offer_additional_help.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Recognize the context and intent behind each message. For example, ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should be ""provide_refund_timeline,"" while ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" should be ""reassure_customer.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Focus on the primary action or request in the message. For example, ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card"" is a ""report_problem,"" and ""Hi, I can’t track my order in the app"" is a ""report_tracking_issue.""

10,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction by analyzing the context and action taken.

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group expressions conveying similar sentiments under a unified intent. For example, map ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide guidance to distinguish between actions with different intents. For example, use `ask_new_address` for ""Could you provide me with the new address?"" and `ask_payment_method` for ""Was this with a credit card or PayPal?"".

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Promote precise intent identification even when messages seem similar. Classify ""Okay, let me check."" as `acknowledge` and ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. Classify ""Perfect, thank you for the help."" as `express_gratitude`, while ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be labeled as `acknowledge`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for dealing with messages containing multiple intents, ensuring each intent is identified. For instance, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure messages with similar outcomes are consistently labeled. For example, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual information to disambiguate similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify intent definitions to avoid overlaps and ensure distinct categorization. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation`, while ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be `end_request`.

9. **Reinforce the Importance of Contextual Understanding:** Emphasize understanding the conversation context to accurately assign intents. For instance, distinguish between ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order."" as `report_billing_issue` and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" as `report_payment_failure`.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize grouping similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" to avoid false splits. For example, phrases like ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" and ""You too! Take care."" should consistently be categorized together.

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Highlight specific language cues to differentiate between similar intents. For instance, distinguish ""ask_clarification"" (""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"") from ""request_order_number"" (""Can you share the order number with me?"").

1,warm_start,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

By following these guidelines, ensure accurate and consistent classification of customer support messages based on their true intents.",,,,0.5220225073971582,0.8842336482615645,0.5127582017010935,0.4615898661904387,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

2,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Use clear examples to illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent to avoid false splits. For instance, ensure phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" are consistently categorized under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Similar Intents:** Provide detailed examples to distinguish closely related intents. Differentiate between ""ask_voucher_code"" and ""ask_order_number"" with specific language cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Reinforce the importance of understanding the conversation context to correctly identify intents. Recognize intents like ""diagnose_issue"" versus ""offer_compensation"" by understanding the broader service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear and consistent examples for each intent to prevent confusion. Ensure phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are always classified as ""acknowledge.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Offer guidance on identifying solution-related intents, ensuring different phrasings are recognized under the same intent. For example, both ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll manually add the points to your account now"" should be categorized under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of context and speaker roles to distinguish similar closing phrases and intents. Differentiate between ""close_conversation"" and ""end_request"" by examining the speaker and context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for more granular categorization, especially in broader intent categories. Provide examples of sub-intents, such as distinguishing ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3627834722431216,0.7128959682418796,0.3486943164362518,0.2586268747069112,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly differentiate between intents with similar functions. For example, distinguish between `ask_error_details` (""Sorry to hear that! Are you getting an error message?"") and `request_receipt_number` (""Can you share your receipt number?"").

2. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle differences in context or phrasing to accurately classify intents. For example, differentiate between `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") and `acknowledge` (""Got it, thanks."").

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Use consistent labels for messages leading to the same outcome. For instance, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome"" should be classified as `close_conversation`.

4. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents in a single message. For example, ""You’re welcome. I’ll keep tracking your order until it’s delivered,"" should include both `express_gratitude` and `confirm_followup`.

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to avoid false splits. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should map to `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. For instance, distinguish ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`) from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`).

7. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate intents that might seem similar. For example, separate `ask_new_address` from `report_voucher_issue` to avoid misclassification.

8. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Clarify and redefine overlapping intents to improve accuracy. For example, separate `end_request` (""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"") from `close_conversation` (""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."").

4,feedback_1,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent with examples. For instance, categorize phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" consistently under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Clarify Intent Distinctions with Examples:** Use specific examples to highlight subtle differences between closely related intents. Differentiate ""ask_voucher_code"" from ""ask_order_number"" with cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Stress the importance of understanding the broader conversation context to accurately identify intents. For example, distinguish ""diagnose_issue"" from ""offer_compensation"" by recognizing the specific service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear examples to ensure consistent intent classification. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" should always be classified under ""acknowledge,"" while ""Perfect, thank you"" should be under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Guide the recognition of solution-related intents by categorizing different phrasings under the same intent. For instance, ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" should fall under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of speaker roles and context to distinguish similar closing phrases. Differentiate ""close_conversation"" from ""end_request"" by identifying whether the speaker is the customer or assistant and examining the conversation context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for granular categorization within broader intents. Distinguish ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank"" by recognizing when gratitude is expressed standalone versus when it accompanies acknowledgment of a solution.

8. **Encourage Use of Speaker Context:** Stress the importance of identifying the speaker (customer or assistant) to accurately classify intents, particularly in mixed dialogues. This helps avoid errors like merging intents that belong to different roles, such as ""describe_issue"" and ""confirm_overcharge.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages for improved intent discovery and reduced errors.",0.0,,,0.3392932480499438,0.6273454689869914,0.2936630602782071,0.2128540818220116,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly define and differentiate between intents with similar functions. For instance, distinguish between `acknowledge` (""Okay, let me check."") and `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") to avoid confusion and ensure precise clustering.

2. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents within a single message. For example, in ""No worries, resetting usually solves this problem. Would you like me to guide you through it?"", recognize both `offer_solution` and `offer_assistance`.

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Ensure that similar messages consistently lead to the same intent label. For example, both ""Appreciate the help!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should be labeled as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle contextual differences to enhance precision in intent classification. Distinguish between `report_problem` (""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."") and `report_login_issue` (""Hi, I can’t log in to the app anymore."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to prevent false splits. Ensure that ""Much appreciated!"" and ""Thanks, that works."" are categorized under `express_gratitude`.

6. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate overlapping intents. For instance, clearly separate `request_update_address` from `report_forgot_password` to avoid misclassification.

7. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Provide distinct definitions for overlapping intent categories to enhance classification accuracy. For example, differentiate between `provide_refund_timeline` and `explain_reason` for refund-related messages.

8. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. Distinguish between ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`) and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`).

9. **Incorporate Disambiguation Cues:** Add cues or examples to help distinguish often-confused intents. Differentiate between `offer_additional_help` (""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"") and `offer_solution` (""Would you like me to issue you a different voucher?"") using scenario-based examples.

3,feedback_0,"When assigning a label to each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Recognize messages that share the same intent despite different expressions, while also distinguishing messages with distinct purposes. Use context and the flow of conversation to guide your labeling decisions. 

- **Identify Similar Intents**: Look for messages that express the same intent using different words (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both convey 'acknowledge'). Group these under the same intent.

- **Emphasize Granularity**: Analyze the specific actions or information conveyed. Differentiate messages that appear related but serve different functions (e.g., ""Open the app, tap “Forgot password”, and follow the steps."" vs. ""It was SAVE20."").

- **Differentiate Actions**: Recognize messages with distinct actions or outcomes (e.g., ""I’ve added a $10 voucher to your account."" vs. ""Done. The points are now visible in your balance."") and label them separately.

- **Use Contextual Cues**: Consider the context and conversational flow to determine the intent (e.g., ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" both function as 'close_conversation').

- **Distinguish Similar Responses**: Differentiate between responses with similar wording but different intents (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" vs. ""That’s helpful, thanks!"") by considering their function.

- **Create Comprehensive Labels**: Develop labels that capture both the action and context of the message, ensuring specificity and descriptiveness (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."" needs a distinct label from ""A carton of milk."").

- **Balance Specificity and Generalization**: Find a balance in label specificity. Use broader categories when appropriate, but maintain specificity when messages have distinct intents (e.g., ""I see. What voucher code are you trying to use?"" vs. ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"").

By following these guidelines, you'll improve your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, enhancing the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.2866114621833696,0.824207215844252,0.2334455667789001,0.2362272352752052,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"Classify each input according to the following refined list of intents, taking into account the context and the role of the speaker (customer vs. assistant). Pay special attention to distinguishing between closely related intents and understanding the nuances of each category:

1. **report_wrong_order**: Identifying issues with a received order.
2. **report_missing_receipt**: Notifying about the absence of a receipt.
3. **suggest_troubleshooting**: Offering solutions to resolve an issue.
4. **acknowledge**: Recognizing or validating a statement or concern. Note that acknowledgment may coexist with gratitude but should be identified as distinct when acknowledging an action or solution.
5. **explain_reason**: Providing explanations for a situation or decision.
6. **describe_issue**: Detailing a specific problem or concern.
7. **request_replacement**: Asking for a new item in place of a faulty one.
8. **express_gratitude**: Thanking or showing appreciation. Differentiate from accepting solutions or closing conversations when gratitude is the primary intent.
9. **provide_order_number**: Supplying a reference or order number.
10. **close_conversation**: Ending the interaction. Identify when this overlaps with gratitude or other intents and determine which is predominant.
11. **accept_solution**: Agreeing to a proposed resolution. Distinguish from mere expressions of satisfaction or gratitude.
12. **offer_compensation**: Proposing a benefit as reparation.
13. **confirm_action**: Verifying that a task has been completed. Differentiate from offering solutions or confirming follow-ups.
14. **offer_discount**: Providing a price reduction as a goodwill gesture.
15. **confirm_followup**: Assuring ongoing tracking or future actions. Differentiate from confirming immediate actions.
16. **ask_payment_method**: Inquiring about the payment type used.
17. **ask_new_timeslot**: Requesting a preferred time for scheduling.
18. **provide_guidance**: Giving instructions or advice on how to proceed. Differentiate when both suggesting alternatives and providing guidance are involved.

Consider the intent's predominant purpose, context, and speaker role, ensuring that similar intents are grouped and differentiated accurately. Use examples to guide the classification, highlight common pitfalls, and provide corrective examples to avoid errors such as false splits and merges in intent classification.",0.0,,,0.3206978324821099,0.4225476791566757,0.2803418803418804,0.1355101248258919,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"When labeling each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by carefully examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Here are key guidelines to assist in accurate intent discovery:

1. **Clarify Intent Identification**:
   - Identify messages that convey the same intent despite different expressions (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be labeled as 'accept_solution'). Emphasize recognizing varied phrasing for similar intents.

2. **Enhance Differentiation of Actions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between messages with different actions or outcomes (e.g., ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."" should be labeled 'report_problem', while ""Yes, I tried both. Still doesn't work."" should be 'confirm_attempted_solution').

3. **Highlight the Need for Granularity**:
   - Focus on specific actions or outcomes in messages (e.g., ""You’re very welcome! Let me know if you need more help after resetting."" should be 'offer_followup' and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be 'end_request').

4. **Encourage Contextual Analysis**:
   - Use context and conversation flow to determine intent (e.g., ""I understand, that must be frustrating. Have you tried rescanning it or adding it to the app?"" should be 'suggest_troubleshooting', and ""Thanks. That code is only valid for orders above $50."" should be 'explain_restriction').

5. **Improve Label Specificity**:
   - Create labels that encapsulate both the action and context (e.g., ""Done, your profile has been updated."" should have a distinct label from ""Got it. I’ve updated your delivery slot to 6–8 pm."" by considering the specific updates being confirmed).

6. **Balance Specificity and Generalization**:
   - Find a balance between broad and specific categories (e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Thanks, that works."" should consistently be labeled as 'express_gratitude' to avoid false splits).

7. **Distinguish Function in Similar Responses**:
   - Differentiate responses with similar wording but different functions (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" should be labeled 'accept_solution', while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be 'express_gratitude', based on their contextual function).

By integrating these guidelines, you'll enhance your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, improving the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.3597713988131546,0.688632331720567,0.3021690351533284,0.2477502172510727,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

   - ""express_gratitude"": Expressions of thankfulness (e.g., ""Thank you so much!"")

2. **Provide Examples for Disambiguation**: Use examples to distinguish intents:
   - ""Okay, thanks for checking."" (acknowledge)
   - ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" (express_gratitude)

3. **Emphasize Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to distinguish intents, especially in assistant messages:
   - ""close_conversation"": When the conversation is ending (e.g., ""Take care!"")
   - ""offer_additional_help"": When further assistance is offered (e.g., ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"")

4. **Reinforce Intent Consistency**: Maintain consistent categorization for similar intents to avoid splits:
   - ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" should consistently be categorized under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Highlight Specificity in Instructions**: Be specific when categorizing requests or instructions:
   - ""request_order_number"": Specific request for the order number (e.g., ""Can you share the order number with me?"")
   - ""ask_order_number"": General inquiry for the order number (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"")

6. **Encourage Flexibility in Interpretation**: Allow flexibility for variations in phrasing to ensure accurate categorization:
   - ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" may accommodate slight variations in phrasing while maintaining their distinct categories.

7. **Include Common Closing Phrases**: Group common closing phrases under ""close_conversation"" for consistent classification:
   - Examples include ""Thank you for reaching out!"" and ""Have a great day!""

8. **Provide More Contextual Scenarios**: Expand on typical conversation flows to illustrate how intents may transition or overlap:
   - For example, moving from ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the interaction concludes.

10,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between intents such as ""request_order_number"" (where a customer is explicitly asking for their order number) and ""ask_order_number"" (where a customer might be inquiring if they need to provide their order number).

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Recognize that similar phrases often share the same intent. For example, phrases like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation."" Maintain consistency across similar expressions.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Understand that different phrases can convey the same intent. For instance, ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should both be categorized under the ""acknowledge"" intent.

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use contextual cues to distinguish between intents. For example, the intent behind ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (likely ""close_conversation"") differs from ""No, that’s all"" (possibly ""end_request"") based on conversation context.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Aim for a balanced level of granularity. Avoid overly detailed distinctions like ""request_order_number"" vs. ""ask_order_number"" unless necessary for specific business goals.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Use examples such as ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" to illustrate how similar queries can reflect different intents, such as ""apology"" versus ""request_order_number,"" depending on context and phrasing.

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents based on the underlying goal of the message. For instance, all forms of closing statements should be under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Implement strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.3808945168581792,0.7729468599033816,0.3720930232558139,0.2944112207599453,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

12,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group expressions that close a conversation together, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from standalone expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me.""

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Differentiate between gratitude and confirmation. For example, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be seen as a ""confirm_solution"" followed by ""express_gratitude,"" whereas ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" primarily expresses gratitude.

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Maintain consistency in grouping similar acknowledgments. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped based on context unless differentiated by specific actions.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents are present within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" which offers help and seeks further engagement.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use conversation context to determine intents, such as classifying both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" under ""provide_order_number.""

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges, using examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to show when gratitude is a distinct intent.

13,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiate between closely related intents, and use consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Identify Similar Intents:**
   - Example: ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!"" both have the intent: close_conversation.

2. **Differentiate Close Intents:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" has the intent: express_gratitude, while ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge.

3. **Consistent Language Use:**
   - Use standardized terminology for similar requests, such as ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" both having the intent: request_order_number.

4. **Encourage Intent Grouping:**
   - Example: ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""assistant: Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both have the intent: offer_additional_help.

5. **Refine Acknowledgment vs. Gratitude:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge, while ""customer: Got it, thanks."" has the intent: express_gratitude.

6. **Disambiguate Instructional Content:**
   - Example: ""assistant: No worries. You can reset it by tapping “Forgot password” on the login screen."" and ""assistant: Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English."" both have the intent: provide_instructions.

7. **Highlight Intent Continuity:**
   - Example: ""customer: No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" and ""customer: No, that’s all."" both have the intent: end_request.

14,feedback_0,"Classify each statement as either ""customer"" or ""assistant"" and provide a corresponding intent label. 

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding or agreement, often with neutral responses.
   - Example: ""Okay, let me check.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases are often neutral confirmations, while gratitude phrases express thanks.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Cross-reference with other examples to ensure accurate intent classification.
- Incorporate a review step to prevent false merges of distinct intents.",6.0,,,0.2292799157896447,0.5185093167701863,0.1614906832298136,0.1188837724852145,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

15,feedback_0,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Below are guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Clearly differentiate between similar intents, such as:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without further action. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Examples: ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - For intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"", look for explicit gratitude terms to categorize as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Ensure uniformity in labeling similar responses. E.g., categorize both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Decide on a consistent approach for messages like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" Determine if they should be split into separate intents or fall under a broader category like ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For instance, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be marked as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically evaluate and adjust intent categories to ensure they align with evolving customer interaction trends.

8. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Provide specific instructions for phrases that may fit multiple intents. Use context cues to determine the most appropriate intent.

By following these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and clarity of intent categorization in customer service interactions.",7.0,,,0.3644745725009509,0.7728260869565217,0.3103448275862068,0.2816754576610609,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

4. **give_tip**: Identify suggestions or advice not directly instructing the user on a specific action, e.g., ""If you don’t see the email, please check your spam folder.""

5. **confirm_process**: Define this category for confirming a process will occur, without providing additional instructions, such as ""Your refund is being processed.""

7. **close_conversation**: Use this for messages that explicitly indicate the end of an interaction, whether or not they contain gratitude, like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **resolve_issue**: Consolidate statements related to solutions and timelines for resolving issues, such as ""The refund will be processed in 3-5 days"" and ""We can offer you a replacement.""

17,feedback_1,"Categorize each interaction based on its intent or action with the following guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Ensure similar expressions are consistently categorized under the same intent:
   - ""close_conversation"": Use for expressions that conclude the interaction (e.g., ""Glad I could help!"", ""You’re very welcome!"", ""Take care!"", ""Thank you for reaching out!"")

2. **Disambiguate Gratitude and Solution Confirmation**: Differentiate between gratitude and solution confirmation, even if they appear together:
   - ""confirm_solution"": Focus on verifying the solution worked (e.g., ""Yes, that worked."")
   - ""express_gratitude"": Focus on thankfulness (e.g., ""Thanks for your help!"")

3. **Utilize Contextual Cues for Assistants**: Identify the primary purpose of assistant messages through context:
   - ""provide_refund_timeline"": Specific information about refund timing (e.g., ""Your refund will be processed in 3-5 days."")
   - ""reassure_customer"": General reassurance without specific timelines (e.g., ""We’re here to help with any issues."")

4. **Maintain Consistent Categorization**: Ensure distinct intents remain separate:
   - ""ask_order_number"": Direct request for order details (e.g., ""Can you provide your order number?"")
   - ""reassure_customer"": Comforting messages (e.g., ""Don't worry, we’ll sort this out."")

5. **Expand Closing Intent Examples**: Include a variety of closing phrases under ""close_conversation"":
   - Examples: ""Have a great day!"", ""Talk to you soon!"", ""You're welcome, anytime!""

6. **Differentiate Between Requests and Instructions**: Clarify distinctions between requests and inquiries:
   - ""request_order_number"": Direct request (e.g., ""Please give me your order number."")
   - ""ask_order_number"": More general inquiry (e.g., ""Could I have your order number?"")

7. **Illustrate Overlapping Intents**: Provide scenarios where intents transition:
   - Example: From ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the dialogue wraps up.

8. **Prioritize Message Purpose**: Focus on the main intent when gratitude and confirmation coexist:
   - ""confirm_solution"": When the main purpose is verifying success (e.g., ""Yes, that's fixed. Thanks!"")

18,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.4430388052552682,0.9128787878787878,0.3555555555555555,0.4044407275246955,"[18. 22. 15.  4. 13.  2. 16.  9. 11.  7.  3. 21. 15.  8. 17.  0. 12.  9.

20,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

22,feedback_1,"Classify each statement as either ""customer"" or ""assistant"" and provide a corresponding intent label.

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding, agreement, or readiness to proceed.
   - Example: ""Okay, thanks for checking."" or ""Perfect, I’ll try that now.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

6. **Provide Refund Timeline**: Informing about the duration for processing a refund.
   - Example: ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days.""

7. **Request Order Number**: Asking the customer to provide their order number.
   - Example: ""Can you share the order number with me?""

8. **Confirm Issue**: Verifying or clarifying the problem or concern presented.
   - Example: ""So, the item was damaged on arrival?""

9. **Give Tip**: Offering helpful suggestions without detailed steps.
   - Example: ""It might help to restart your device.""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases can signal readiness to proceed or confirm understanding.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.
- Maintain separate intents for messages that convey different actions or requests, even if they appear in quick succession.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Encourage ongoing review and refinement based on new data or ambiguous cases.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for users to flag difficult-to-classify messages for further analysis and definition adjustment.",6.0,,,0.4699180112633404,0.5492063492063491,0.3855421686746987,0.2580819553922472,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

23,feedback_1,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Follow these refined guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Provide clear definitions to differentiate similar intents:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without explicit gratitude. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Strengthen differentiation cues for intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"". Explicit gratitude terms such as ""thanks"" or ""appreciate"" should be categorized as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Maintain uniformity in labeling similar responses. For instance, both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should be labeled as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Provide clear instructions for messages with multiple intents. Decide whether to split into separate intents or choose a primary one, e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" could be split into ""Acknowledge"" and ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between overlapping intents like ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For example, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be categorized as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Use context to interpret ambiguous phrases, ensuring specificity. For instance, differentiate ""offer_alternative_updates"" from ""explain_issue"" by context in messages like ""I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives.""

8. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Emphasize the importance of regularly updating intent categories to reflect changes in customer interaction patterns, minimizing errors like ""false_merge"" and ""false_split"".

9. **Illustrate with Error Examples:**
   - Use specific examples to illustrate common mistakes and corrections. For instance, separate ""Great, how long will the refund take?"" from ""ask_order_number"" to clarify distinct intents.

By implementing these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and consistency of intent categorization in customer service interactions.",7.0,,,0.3406907170441308,0.6316205533596838,0.2972972972972973,0.2151872592239213,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

0,warm_start,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiating between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some refined guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:**
   - Example: Differentiate ""assistant: Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed."" (intent: confirm_issue) from ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" (intent: acknowledge).

2. **Avoid False Merges:**
   - Example: Distinguish ""customer: That’s helpful, thanks!"" (intent: express_gratitude) from ""customer: Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" (intent: confirm_solution).

3. **Standardize Instructional Language:**
   - Example: Separate ""assistant: If you don’t see the email, please check your spam folder."" (intent: give_tip) from ""assistant: I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives."" (intent: offer_alternative_updates).

4. **Consistent Recognition of Similar Intents:**
   - Example: Ensure consistency in labeling ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" as (intent: close_conversation).

5. **Refine Request Differentiation:**
   - Example: Use consistent labeling for ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" as (intent: request_order_number).

6. **Disambiguate Similar Yet Distinct Intents:**
   - Example: Differentiate ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" (intent: offer_additional_help) from ""assistant: I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives."" (intent: offer_alternative_updates).

7. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Example: Understand context to differentiate ""offer_additional_help"" from ""give_tip,"" ensuring accurate capture of message purposes.

8. **Reinforce Intent Consistency:**
   - Example: Maintain consistent labeling for intents such as ""close_conversation,"" even with slight phrasings like ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!""

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

3,warm_start,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",,,,0.5226651228327732,0.9039226080042408,0.4666666666666667,0.4724488209438572,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

4,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiating between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some refined guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Enhance Recognition of Similar Phrasings for Consistent Intents:**
   - Consistently label expressions of gratitude such as ""Okay, thanks for the advice,"" ""Got it, thanks,"" and ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" as (intent: express_gratitude).

2. **Differentiate Closely Related Intents:**
   - Emphasize recognizing specific actions or agreements to differentiate intents like ""provide_payment_method"" and ""agree_to_try."" For example, distinguish ""With a credit card"" from ""I’ll try PayPal.""

3. **Clarify Intent Boundaries for Endings and Closures:**
   - Reinforce the difference between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation,"" distinguishing messages like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" from ""Great. Have a wonderful day!""

4. **Use Consistent Terminology for Similar Actions:**
   - Standardize intent labels like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" as (intent: offer_solution).

5. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Highlight the importance of context to differentiate similar intents like ""offer_additional_help"" and ""offer_alternative_updates.""

6. **Standardize Language for Common Requests:**
   - Use consistent intent labeling for requests such as ""request_order_number"" by recognizing similar phrasing.

7. **Reinforce Consistency in Closing Statements:**
   - Ensure that intents like ""close_conversation"" are consistently applied to varied phrasings like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **Disambiguate Errors and Solutions:**
   - Clarify the separation between describing an error and agreeing to a solution, as seen in messages like ""Yes, it said 'transaction declined'"" and ""I’ll try PayPal.""

By focusing on these areas, the intent discovery process can produce more accurate and meaningful clusters, reducing instances of both false splits and merges.",0.0,,,0.4251179299910477,0.6839569160997733,0.448,0.2907623483753963,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

5,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Stress the importance of distinguishing between expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" and standalone gratitude expressions like ""Thank you for helping me,"" unless part of a closing dialogue.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide examples to differentiate similar intents like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be primarily labeled as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Emphasize consistency when clustering acknowledgments. Use context to decide if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped together or separately, depending on the specific action each acknowledgment implies.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Illustrate when multiple intents are present in a single message. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should encompass both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance.""

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Encourage using the surrounding conversation context to accurately determine intents. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number"" based on the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

By adhering to these guidelines, ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing the likelihood of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.5866176001462057,0.9064625850340136,0.6375,0.5317469062549789,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

6,feedback_0,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content. 

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly distinguish intents such as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude."" Use ""close_conversation"" for messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" which aim to conclude an interaction.

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Provide distinct categories for similar intents. For instance, separate ""ask_order_number"" (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"") as they seek different information.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Ensure all expressions of thanks are consistently categorized under ""express_gratitude,"" such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use context to differentiate similar intents like ""provide_new_address"" (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."") from ""provide_guidance"" (e.g., ""If the card still fails later, contact your bank for details."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Specify when to split or merge intents based on differences, such as separating ""confirm_action"" (e.g., ""I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent."") from ""confirm_overcharge"" (e.g., ""You were indeed charged twice for delivery."").

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents like ""report_payment_failure"" (e.g., ""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"").

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing ""accept_solution"" (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders."").

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents, such as differentiating ""describe_issue"" (e.g., ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders.""). 

By following these guidelines, enhance the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.4532005658934174,0.8261070526695526,0.4508196721311475,0.3743921837583844,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

7,feedback_0,"### Improved Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",3.0,,,0.7327216376763207,0.9560090702947844,0.7560975609756097,0.7004885316198113,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

8,feedback_1,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, accurately identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, clearly distinguishing between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are refined guidelines and examples to assist you:

1. **Consistent Recognition for Acknowledgment:**
   - Ensure that acknowledgment expressions like ""Perfect, I’ll try that now,"" ""Okay, let me check,"" and ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are consistently labeled as (intent: acknowledge).

2. **Differentiate Information Requests and Solution Offers:**
   - Clearly differentiate intents such as ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" from ""offer_solution."" For example, distinguish ""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"" from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

3. **Refine Problem Reporting vs. Update Requests:**
   - Precisely differentiate intents like ""report_billing_issue"" from ""request_update_address."" For instance, distinguish ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" from ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address.""

4. **Standardize Intent Labeling for Similar Actions:**
   - Recognize similar phrasing for actions like ""offer_solution,"" such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account.""

5. **Clarify Boundaries for Similar Requests:**
   - Reinforce differentiation between similar intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"" with clear examples, such as ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" versus ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

6. **Disambiguate Confirming Actions vs. Reassuring Customers:**
   - Highlight the difference between ""confirm_action"" and ""reassure_customer."" For example, differentiate ""Perfect, I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent to your address"" from ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot.""

7. **Standardize Language for Gratitude and Closures:**
   - Consistently apply intent labels like ""close_conversation"" to varied phrasings such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!""

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding for Similar Intents:**
   - Emphasize context to distinguish similar intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""explain_issue."" For instance, contrast ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" with ""Thank you. I see the order is on its way, but the tracking system is delayed.""

9,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Evaluate the role of each message in the conversation to correctly identify its intent. For example, in a billing issue context, ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" should be understood as ""offer_solution.""

- **Refine Instructions for Distinguishing Closing Statements:** Differentiate between expressions that close a conversation and those that offer gratitude. For instance, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" should be categorized as ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s everything"" should be recognized as ""end_request.""

- **Improve Differentiation of Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples to distinguish similar intents, such as ""provide_refund_timeline"" versus general refund information. Statements like ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should fall under ""provide_refund_timeline.""

- **Incorporate Examples for Disambiguating Instructions and Solutions:** Use examples like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" for ""offer_solution"" and ""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen"" for ""provide_instructions.""

- **Highlight the Need for Consistent Acknowledgment Clustering:** Use context to decide whether acknowledgment phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" should be combined into a single intent or kept separate.

- **Address Multi-Intent Messages Clearly:** Illustrate how to handle messages with multiple intents. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" should be recognized as ""offer_solution"" and potentially involve other intents depending on the broader query.

- **Provide Clear Guidelines for Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents exist within a single message and classify them accurately without false merges.

- **Include Examples of Gratitude as a Distinct Intent:** Demonstrate situations where gratitude should be a standalone intent, such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" to prevent incorrect merges with other intents.

By implementing these guidelines, ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing the likelihood of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.2833505640445911,0.8491842624495686,0.2005277044854881,0.2406168397428753,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

10,feedback_1,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content.

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly define each intent with examples. Use ""close_conversation"" for statements intended to end an interaction, such as ""Have a great day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Differentiate from ""express_gratitude,"" which includes expressions like ""Thank you for the help.""

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Create distinct categories for intents that are contextually different. For example, ""request_order_number"" involves asking for an order number, such as ""Can you share the order number with me?"" while ""ask_order_number"" might be used in different contexts.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Group similar expressions under the same intent consistently. For instance, all expressions of gratitude, including ""Perfect, thank you for the help,"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate between similar intents. For example, distinguish ""provide_instructions"" (""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen."") from ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by the nature of the message.

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Provide clear criteria for when to split or merge intents. For instance, differentiate ""confirm_solution"" (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"") from ""express_gratitude"" based on the action or confirmation involved.

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents. For instance, distinguish ""report_payment_failure"" (""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (""Did you receive any error message?"") with context on the inquiry.

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing intents like ""accept_solution"" (""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (""Please for all future orders."") to ensure clarity.

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Train the model to understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents. For example, differentiate ""describe_issue"" (""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" by analyzing the surrounding context.

By following these guidelines, improve the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.3875018203734508,0.7008092715723595,0.3928571428571429,0.2715648684688814,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

11,feedback_1,"### Refined Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This involves tagging each response with a specific intent label to effectively guide the conversation. Follow these enhanced instructions for precise intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Define each intent clearly and provide examples to prevent confusion. For instance, differentiate between ""confirm_update"" and ""confirm_overcharge"" with examples such as ""Done, your profile has been updated"" for ""confirm_update"" and ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" for ""confirm_overcharge.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For example, consistently tag ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as ""close_conversation"" to avoid splitting into ""end_request"" or ""close_conversation"" based on minor wording variations.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how context can alter a message's intent. For instance, differentiate ""I’ll try PayPal"" as ""agree_to_try"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" as ""acknowledge,"" using context to guide intent recognition.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid unnecessary granularity unless it aligns with business objectives. For example, decide when to split intents like ""provide_instructions"" and ""provide_guidance"" based on their business significance.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Offer detailed examples of false merges to clarify intent distinctions. For instance, distinguish ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address"" as ""request_update_address"" from ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield"" as ""provide_new_address.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Group intents based on broader goals. Ensure all phrases aiming to close a conversation are tagged under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of wording differences.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Suggest strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as using previous interactions to differentiate intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation."" Clarify when ""No, that’s everything"" should be an ""end_request"" versus ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include diverse examples, particularly from error cases, to guide correct categorization. Differentiate intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by considering scenarios where context determines the intent, such as offering a refund versus suggesting a fix.

By applying these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and consistency of intent identification in customer service interactions, enhancing the overall customer experience.",3.0,,,0.4928677186328189,0.9332563213964832,0.4065040650406503,0.4599719140263414,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",,,,0.6402509353401891,0.922481612966042,0.6461538461538462,0.5906197155356346,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",,,,0.3989429219702807,0.7985149308618041,0.4351145038167939,0.3185618797549048,"[73.  7. 32. 84. 21. 33. 48.  2. 20. 39. 19. 69.  8. 31. 84. 40. 44.  1.

2,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on merging intents that serve similar functions. For example, combine ""acknowledge_and_thank"" with ""express_gratitude"" unless there are explicit reasons to keep them separate. Use examples such as ""customer: Okay, I’ll do that now. Thanks for your support!"" and ""customer: Perfect, thank you for the help."" to illustrate this consolidation.

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases to avoid false splits. For instance, ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be tagged as ""accept_solution."" Use these phrases to demonstrate the importance of consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how conversation context can alter intent interpretation. For example, ""Okay, let me check."" can imply ""acknowledge"" or ""accept_solution"" depending on preceding messages. Use examples like ""customer: That would be good."" and ""customer: Oh, I didn’t realize."" to show context's impact on intent.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions unless necessary for business objectives. Illustrate this by addressing errors such as tagging ""provide_refund_timeline"" and ""provide_instructions"" separately without clear differentiation.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to show how context alters intent, preventing false merges. For instance, differentiate ""customer: Awesome, appreciate the help!"" from ""customer: Perfect, thank you."" as ""express_gratitude"" and ""accept_solution"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their overarching goal. For example, all phrases related to closing should fall under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of specific wording. Use examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" to emphasize this point.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as analyzing the conversation stage or prior interactions. For example, differentiate between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation"" based on whether further action is implied.

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a wider range of examples to cover common pitfalls. For instance, differentiate ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_overcharge"" with scenarios like ""customer: I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.3180827175924228,0.7218621463737009,0.2480286738351254,0.229611873245646,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they appear in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""close_conversation"".

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" fall under ""acknowledge"" or if they indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" as ""provide_order_number"" if they respond to a request for an order number.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they serve a dual purpose.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.3768676215114094,0.681635416368167,0.4010791366906475,0.2568863181046104,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on when to merge intents and when to keep them distinct. Combine intents that express similar functions, such as gratitude or closure, unless the context significantly changes their meaning. For example, merge ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help!"" under ""close_conversation"".

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases by using specific examples. For instance, ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both be tagged as ""express_gratitude"". Highlight these to stress the importance of uniformity in tagging similar expressions.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Clearly illustrate how context can change intent interpretation. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" could mean ""provide_order_number"" if followed by order-related queries. Use such examples to show how preceding messages can shift intent, preventing errors like false merges.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions that do not serve a clear business purpose. For example, differentiate between ""provide_item_details"" and ""describe_error_message"" only when necessary. Ensure clarity in examples like ""Yes, it says my password is incorrect."" versus ""A carton of milk."" to prevent incorrect merges.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to illustrate how seemingly similar intents may require separation. For example, do not merge ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s FREEDELIVERY."" as they represent ""provide_order_number"" and ""provide_voucher_code"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their ultimate goal, such as merging all closing phrases under ""close_conversation"". This prevents false splits seen in examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""You’re very welcome!"", which should be unified under a single intent.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer practical strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation stage or examining previous interactions. For example, differentiate intents like ""confirm_refund"" and ""provide_payment_method"" based on context, seen in ""Refund has been processed."" versus ""With a credit card.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a broader range of examples that capture common pitfalls. Differentiate between ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" using scenarios such as ""I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential errors.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.6268253842488088,0.9031630258115054,0.6115288220551379,0.5661255106936137,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they follow a gratitude expression in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""express_gratitude"" unless used to conclude the exchange.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" are acknowledgments or indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context and surrounding conversation.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" as ""provide_order_number"" only if it responds to a request for an order number. Ensure that context is considered in scenarios where intent might be ambiguous.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they are part of a dual-purpose exchange.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.4376941079486332,0.7372108438517107,0.4864341085271318,0.3226728426697336,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_0,"Categorize each interaction between a customer and an assistant by examining both the wording and the context to determine the true intent or purpose of the message. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Recognize when messages should be grouped under a single intent versus when they should be split. Variations in phrasing do not indicate different intents if the underlying purpose is the same. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" both serve the intent of ""close_conversation"".

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Focus on the specific issue or action being described, rather than general similarities. Identify unique aspects of the message content that signal different intents, such as distinguishing between ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Identify common phrases that share the same intent despite appearing different. For example, ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" and ""Got it, thanks."" both express ""express_gratitude"".

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual cues to identify the broader intent, such as offering further assistance or closing the conversation. Messages like ""Happy to help! Anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both offer ""offer_additional_help"".

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Recognize that complex interactions may involve multiple distinct intents. Break down messages to discern different stages or aspects of the conversation, such as distinguishing ""report_problem"" from ""confirm_attempted_solution"".

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Look for specific problem descriptions that differentiate intents, even when they seem related. For example, ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."" and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be separate as ""describe_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

By following these guidelines, you can accurately categorize each interaction to improve the clustering accuracy of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3309779514644528,0.7885051456480029,0.3107569721115538,0.260977817825756,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

5,feedback_0,"Classify the given text into one of the predefined categories based on its intended outcome. 

**Guidelines:**
1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate similar intents. For example, phrases like ""You're welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should be grouped under ""close_conversation,"" whereas ""Thank you"" belongs to ""express_gratitude.""
   
2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Focus on the distinct action or response expected. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" should be categorized as ""confirm_update,"" while ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" falls under ""confirm_overcharge.""

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Look for keywords indicating a question (e.g., ""Could you,"" ""Can you"") versus a statement (e.g., ""You can,"" ""It is possible"") to differentiate intents like ""ask_new_address"" and ""provide_guidance.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Recognize that different phrasings can map to the same intent. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" both belong to ""close_conversation.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Consider the context and the action or reassurance being communicated. For example, ""Yes, you’ll receive an email"" should be ""confirm_process,"" while ""If you don’t see the email"" should be ""give_tip.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Identify the primary action or request. For example, ""Got it. Do you want to apply this change"" is a request for confirmation, while ""Hi, I can’t track my order"" indicates a request for assistance.

6,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

7,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts. Ensure accurate clustering by considering the following:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" with examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Differentiate between similar intents by recognizing nuances, such as ""confirm_issue"" (e.g., ""Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed."") versus ""acknowledge"" (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."").

3. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:** Consider the context in which a message is sent. For example, distinguish between requesting information (""Can you share the order number with me?"") and confirming a solution (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"").

4. **Standardize Intent Definitions:** Use consistent definitions for each intent, such as ""express_gratitude,"" with examples like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Perfect, thank you for the help.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Phrasing:** Recognize solution-related intents despite varied phrasing, such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues:** Distinguish between similar closing phrases using context and speaker roles, such as ""Have a great day."" (closing conversation) versus ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (ending a request).

8,feedback_1,"Determine the true intent or purpose of each interaction between a customer and an assistant by analyzing both the wording and context. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Group messages with the same underlying purpose, regardless of phrasing differences. For example, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" share the ""close_conversation"" intent. Focus on the core purpose behind the wording.

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Examine the specific content and action described to identify distinct intents, even for similar messages. Differentiate between intents like ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" by determining if the goal is to clarify a general issue or request specific information.

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Recognize phrases that, despite different wording, share the same intent. For instance, ""Okay, let me check."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both indicate ""acknowledge"" and should be grouped under this intent.

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to understand broader intents, such as concluding an interaction or offering further help. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Take care!"" both indicate a ""close_conversation"" intent.

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Break down complex interactions into multiple intents. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be separated into ""apologize"" and ""ask_order_number"" to reflect different conversation stages.

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Focus on specific details that separate intents, even if they seem related. Distinguish between ""confirm_update"" and ""provide_order_number"" by identifying the specific action or information being confirmed or provided.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Differentiate between intents with distinct purposes using contextual cues. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account."" should be categorized under ""offer_solution"" as they both involve problem-solving actions.

2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Identify unique actions to prevent incorrect merging of intents. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" is ""confirm_update,"" while ""I’ll try PayPal"" involves ""agree_to_try,"" reflecting different intents.

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Use specific keywords or phrases to distinguish inquiries from guidance. For example, ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" is ""reassure_customer,"" while ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" is ""provide_instructions.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Group expressions with similar sentiments under the same intent. For instance, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should be categorized as ""offer_additional_help.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Recognize the context and intent behind each message. For example, ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should be ""provide_refund_timeline,"" while ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" should be ""reassure_customer.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Focus on the primary action or request in the message. For example, ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card"" is a ""report_problem,"" and ""Hi, I can’t track my order in the app"" is a ""report_tracking_issue.""

10,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction by analyzing the context and action taken.

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group expressions conveying similar sentiments under a unified intent. For example, map ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide guidance to distinguish between actions with different intents. For example, use `ask_new_address` for ""Could you provide me with the new address?"" and `ask_payment_method` for ""Was this with a credit card or PayPal?"".

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Promote precise intent identification even when messages seem similar. Classify ""Okay, let me check."" as `acknowledge` and ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. Classify ""Perfect, thank you for the help."" as `express_gratitude`, while ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be labeled as `acknowledge`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for dealing with messages containing multiple intents, ensuring each intent is identified. For instance, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure messages with similar outcomes are consistently labeled. For example, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual information to disambiguate similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify intent definitions to avoid overlaps and ensure distinct categorization. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation`, while ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be `end_request`.

9. **Reinforce the Importance of Contextual Understanding:** Emphasize understanding the conversation context to accurately assign intents. For instance, distinguish between ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order."" as `report_billing_issue` and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" as `report_payment_failure`.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize grouping similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" to avoid false splits. For example, phrases like ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" and ""You too! Take care."" should consistently be categorized together.

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Highlight specific language cues to differentiate between similar intents. For instance, distinguish ""ask_clarification"" (""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"") from ""request_order_number"" (""Can you share the order number with me?"").

1,warm_start,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

By following these guidelines, ensure accurate and consistent classification of customer support messages based on their true intents.",,,,0.5220225073971582,0.8842336482615645,0.5127582017010935,0.4615898661904387,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

2,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Use clear examples to illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent to avoid false splits. For instance, ensure phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" are consistently categorized under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Similar Intents:** Provide detailed examples to distinguish closely related intents. Differentiate between ""ask_voucher_code"" and ""ask_order_number"" with specific language cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Reinforce the importance of understanding the conversation context to correctly identify intents. Recognize intents like ""diagnose_issue"" versus ""offer_compensation"" by understanding the broader service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear and consistent examples for each intent to prevent confusion. Ensure phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are always classified as ""acknowledge.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Offer guidance on identifying solution-related intents, ensuring different phrasings are recognized under the same intent. For example, both ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll manually add the points to your account now"" should be categorized under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of context and speaker roles to distinguish similar closing phrases and intents. Differentiate between ""close_conversation"" and ""end_request"" by examining the speaker and context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for more granular categorization, especially in broader intent categories. Provide examples of sub-intents, such as distinguishing ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3627834722431216,0.7128959682418796,0.3486943164362518,0.2586268747069112,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly differentiate between intents with similar functions. For example, distinguish between `ask_error_details` (""Sorry to hear that! Are you getting an error message?"") and `request_receipt_number` (""Can you share your receipt number?"").

2. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle differences in context or phrasing to accurately classify intents. For example, differentiate between `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") and `acknowledge` (""Got it, thanks."").

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Use consistent labels for messages leading to the same outcome. For instance, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome"" should be classified as `close_conversation`.

4. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents in a single message. For example, ""You’re welcome. I’ll keep tracking your order until it’s delivered,"" should include both `express_gratitude` and `confirm_followup`.

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to avoid false splits. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should map to `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. For instance, distinguish ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`) from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`).

7. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate intents that might seem similar. For example, separate `ask_new_address` from `report_voucher_issue` to avoid misclassification.

8. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Clarify and redefine overlapping intents to improve accuracy. For example, separate `end_request` (""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"") from `close_conversation` (""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."").

4,feedback_1,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent with examples. For instance, categorize phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" consistently under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Clarify Intent Distinctions with Examples:** Use specific examples to highlight subtle differences between closely related intents. Differentiate ""ask_voucher_code"" from ""ask_order_number"" with cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Stress the importance of understanding the broader conversation context to accurately identify intents. For example, distinguish ""diagnose_issue"" from ""offer_compensation"" by recognizing the specific service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear examples to ensure consistent intent classification. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" should always be classified under ""acknowledge,"" while ""Perfect, thank you"" should be under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Guide the recognition of solution-related intents by categorizing different phrasings under the same intent. For instance, ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" should fall under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of speaker roles and context to distinguish similar closing phrases. Differentiate ""close_conversation"" from ""end_request"" by identifying whether the speaker is the customer or assistant and examining the conversation context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for granular categorization within broader intents. Distinguish ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank"" by recognizing when gratitude is expressed standalone versus when it accompanies acknowledgment of a solution.

8. **Encourage Use of Speaker Context:** Stress the importance of identifying the speaker (customer or assistant) to accurately classify intents, particularly in mixed dialogues. This helps avoid errors like merging intents that belong to different roles, such as ""describe_issue"" and ""confirm_overcharge.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages for improved intent discovery and reduced errors.",0.0,,,0.3392932480499438,0.6273454689869914,0.2936630602782071,0.2128540818220116,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly define and differentiate between intents with similar functions. For instance, distinguish between `acknowledge` (""Okay, let me check."") and `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") to avoid confusion and ensure precise clustering.

2. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents within a single message. For example, in ""No worries, resetting usually solves this problem. Would you like me to guide you through it?"", recognize both `offer_solution` and `offer_assistance`.

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Ensure that similar messages consistently lead to the same intent label. For example, both ""Appreciate the help!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should be labeled as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle contextual differences to enhance precision in intent classification. Distinguish between `report_problem` (""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."") and `report_login_issue` (""Hi, I can’t log in to the app anymore."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to prevent false splits. Ensure that ""Much appreciated!"" and ""Thanks, that works."" are categorized under `express_gratitude`.

6. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate overlapping intents. For instance, clearly separate `request_update_address` from `report_forgot_password` to avoid misclassification.

7. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Provide distinct definitions for overlapping intent categories to enhance classification accuracy. For example, differentiate between `provide_refund_timeline` and `explain_reason` for refund-related messages.

8. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. Distinguish between ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`) and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`).

9. **Incorporate Disambiguation Cues:** Add cues or examples to help distinguish often-confused intents. Differentiate between `offer_additional_help` (""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"") and `offer_solution` (""Would you like me to issue you a different voucher?"") using scenario-based examples.

3,feedback_0,"When assigning a label to each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Recognize messages that share the same intent despite different expressions, while also distinguishing messages with distinct purposes. Use context and the flow of conversation to guide your labeling decisions. 

- **Identify Similar Intents**: Look for messages that express the same intent using different words (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both convey 'acknowledge'). Group these under the same intent.

- **Emphasize Granularity**: Analyze the specific actions or information conveyed. Differentiate messages that appear related but serve different functions (e.g., ""Open the app, tap “Forgot password”, and follow the steps."" vs. ""It was SAVE20."").

- **Differentiate Actions**: Recognize messages with distinct actions or outcomes (e.g., ""I’ve added a $10 voucher to your account."" vs. ""Done. The points are now visible in your balance."") and label them separately.

- **Use Contextual Cues**: Consider the context and conversational flow to determine the intent (e.g., ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" both function as 'close_conversation').

- **Distinguish Similar Responses**: Differentiate between responses with similar wording but different intents (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" vs. ""That’s helpful, thanks!"") by considering their function.

- **Create Comprehensive Labels**: Develop labels that capture both the action and context of the message, ensuring specificity and descriptiveness (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."" needs a distinct label from ""A carton of milk."").

- **Balance Specificity and Generalization**: Find a balance in label specificity. Use broader categories when appropriate, but maintain specificity when messages have distinct intents (e.g., ""I see. What voucher code are you trying to use?"" vs. ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"").

By following these guidelines, you'll improve your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, enhancing the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.2866114621833696,0.824207215844252,0.2334455667789001,0.2362272352752052,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"Classify each input according to the following refined list of intents, taking into account the context and the role of the speaker (customer vs. assistant). Pay special attention to distinguishing between closely related intents and understanding the nuances of each category:

1. **report_wrong_order**: Identifying issues with a received order.
2. **report_missing_receipt**: Notifying about the absence of a receipt.
3. **suggest_troubleshooting**: Offering solutions to resolve an issue.
4. **acknowledge**: Recognizing or validating a statement or concern. Note that acknowledgment may coexist with gratitude but should be identified as distinct when acknowledging an action or solution.
5. **explain_reason**: Providing explanations for a situation or decision.
6. **describe_issue**: Detailing a specific problem or concern.
7. **request_replacement**: Asking for a new item in place of a faulty one.
8. **express_gratitude**: Thanking or showing appreciation. Differentiate from accepting solutions or closing conversations when gratitude is the primary intent.
9. **provide_order_number**: Supplying a reference or order number.
10. **close_conversation**: Ending the interaction. Identify when this overlaps with gratitude or other intents and determine which is predominant.
11. **accept_solution**: Agreeing to a proposed resolution. Distinguish from mere expressions of satisfaction or gratitude.
12. **offer_compensation**: Proposing a benefit as reparation.
13. **confirm_action**: Verifying that a task has been completed. Differentiate from offering solutions or confirming follow-ups.
14. **offer_discount**: Providing a price reduction as a goodwill gesture.
15. **confirm_followup**: Assuring ongoing tracking or future actions. Differentiate from confirming immediate actions.
16. **ask_payment_method**: Inquiring about the payment type used.
17. **ask_new_timeslot**: Requesting a preferred time for scheduling.
18. **provide_guidance**: Giving instructions or advice on how to proceed. Differentiate when both suggesting alternatives and providing guidance are involved.

Consider the intent's predominant purpose, context, and speaker role, ensuring that similar intents are grouped and differentiated accurately. Use examples to guide the classification, highlight common pitfalls, and provide corrective examples to avoid errors such as false splits and merges in intent classification.",0.0,,,0.3206978324821099,0.4225476791566757,0.2803418803418804,0.1355101248258919,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"When labeling each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by carefully examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Here are key guidelines to assist in accurate intent discovery:

1. **Clarify Intent Identification**:
   - Identify messages that convey the same intent despite different expressions (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be labeled as 'accept_solution'). Emphasize recognizing varied phrasing for similar intents.

2. **Enhance Differentiation of Actions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between messages with different actions or outcomes (e.g., ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."" should be labeled 'report_problem', while ""Yes, I tried both. Still doesn't work."" should be 'confirm_attempted_solution').

3. **Highlight the Need for Granularity**:
   - Focus on specific actions or outcomes in messages (e.g., ""You’re very welcome! Let me know if you need more help after resetting."" should be 'offer_followup' and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be 'end_request').

4. **Encourage Contextual Analysis**:
   - Use context and conversation flow to determine intent (e.g., ""I understand, that must be frustrating. Have you tried rescanning it or adding it to the app?"" should be 'suggest_troubleshooting', and ""Thanks. That code is only valid for orders above $50."" should be 'explain_restriction').

5. **Improve Label Specificity**:
   - Create labels that encapsulate both the action and context (e.g., ""Done, your profile has been updated."" should have a distinct label from ""Got it. I’ve updated your delivery slot to 6–8 pm."" by considering the specific updates being confirmed).

6. **Balance Specificity and Generalization**:
   - Find a balance between broad and specific categories (e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Thanks, that works."" should consistently be labeled as 'express_gratitude' to avoid false splits).

7. **Distinguish Function in Similar Responses**:
   - Differentiate responses with similar wording but different functions (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" should be labeled 'accept_solution', while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be 'express_gratitude', based on their contextual function).

By integrating these guidelines, you'll enhance your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, improving the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.3597713988131546,0.688632331720567,0.3021690351533284,0.2477502172510727,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

   - ""express_gratitude"": Expressions of thankfulness (e.g., ""Thank you so much!"")

2. **Provide Examples for Disambiguation**: Use examples to distinguish intents:
   - ""Okay, thanks for checking."" (acknowledge)
   - ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" (express_gratitude)

3. **Emphasize Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to distinguish intents, especially in assistant messages:
   - ""close_conversation"": When the conversation is ending (e.g., ""Take care!"")
   - ""offer_additional_help"": When further assistance is offered (e.g., ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"")

4. **Reinforce Intent Consistency**: Maintain consistent categorization for similar intents to avoid splits:
   - ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" should consistently be categorized under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Highlight Specificity in Instructions**: Be specific when categorizing requests or instructions:
   - ""request_order_number"": Specific request for the order number (e.g., ""Can you share the order number with me?"")
   - ""ask_order_number"": General inquiry for the order number (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"")

6. **Encourage Flexibility in Interpretation**: Allow flexibility for variations in phrasing to ensure accurate categorization:
   - ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" may accommodate slight variations in phrasing while maintaining their distinct categories.

7. **Include Common Closing Phrases**: Group common closing phrases under ""close_conversation"" for consistent classification:
   - Examples include ""Thank you for reaching out!"" and ""Have a great day!""

8. **Provide More Contextual Scenarios**: Expand on typical conversation flows to illustrate how intents may transition or overlap:
   - For example, moving from ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the interaction concludes.

10,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between intents such as ""request_order_number"" (where a customer is explicitly asking for their order number) and ""ask_order_number"" (where a customer might be inquiring if they need to provide their order number).

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Recognize that similar phrases often share the same intent. For example, phrases like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation."" Maintain consistency across similar expressions.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Understand that different phrases can convey the same intent. For instance, ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should both be categorized under the ""acknowledge"" intent.

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use contextual cues to distinguish between intents. For example, the intent behind ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (likely ""close_conversation"") differs from ""No, that’s all"" (possibly ""end_request"") based on conversation context.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Aim for a balanced level of granularity. Avoid overly detailed distinctions like ""request_order_number"" vs. ""ask_order_number"" unless necessary for specific business goals.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Use examples such as ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" to illustrate how similar queries can reflect different intents, such as ""apology"" versus ""request_order_number,"" depending on context and phrasing.

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents based on the underlying goal of the message. For instance, all forms of closing statements should be under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Implement strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.3808945168581792,0.7729468599033816,0.3720930232558139,0.2944112207599453,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

12,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group expressions that close a conversation together, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from standalone expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me.""

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Differentiate between gratitude and confirmation. For example, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be seen as a ""confirm_solution"" followed by ""express_gratitude,"" whereas ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" primarily expresses gratitude.

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Maintain consistency in grouping similar acknowledgments. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped based on context unless differentiated by specific actions.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents are present within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" which offers help and seeks further engagement.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use conversation context to determine intents, such as classifying both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" under ""provide_order_number.""

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges, using examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to show when gratitude is a distinct intent.

13,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiate between closely related intents, and use consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Identify Similar Intents:**
   - Example: ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!"" both have the intent: close_conversation.

2. **Differentiate Close Intents:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" has the intent: express_gratitude, while ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge.

3. **Consistent Language Use:**
   - Use standardized terminology for similar requests, such as ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" both having the intent: request_order_number.

4. **Encourage Intent Grouping:**
   - Example: ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""assistant: Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both have the intent: offer_additional_help.

5. **Refine Acknowledgment vs. Gratitude:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge, while ""customer: Got it, thanks."" has the intent: express_gratitude.

6. **Disambiguate Instructional Content:**
   - Example: ""assistant: No worries. You can reset it by tapping “Forgot password” on the login screen."" and ""assistant: Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English."" both have the intent: provide_instructions.

7. **Highlight Intent Continuity:**
   - Example: ""customer: No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" and ""customer: No, that’s all."" both have the intent: end_request.

14,feedback_0,"Classify each statement as either ""customer"" or ""assistant"" and provide a corresponding intent label. 

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding or agreement, often with neutral responses.
   - Example: ""Okay, let me check.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases are often neutral confirmations, while gratitude phrases express thanks.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Cross-reference with other examples to ensure accurate intent classification.
- Incorporate a review step to prevent false merges of distinct intents.",6.0,,,0.2292799157896447,0.5185093167701863,0.1614906832298136,0.1188837724852145,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

15,feedback_0,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Below are guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Clearly differentiate between similar intents, such as:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without further action. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Examples: ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - For intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"", look for explicit gratitude terms to categorize as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Ensure uniformity in labeling similar responses. E.g., categorize both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Decide on a consistent approach for messages like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" Determine if they should be split into separate intents or fall under a broader category like ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For instance, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be marked as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically evaluate and adjust intent categories to ensure they align with evolving customer interaction trends.

8. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Provide specific instructions for phrases that may fit multiple intents. Use context cues to determine the most appropriate intent.

By following these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and clarity of intent categorization in customer service interactions.",7.0,,,0.3644745725009509,0.7728260869565217,0.3103448275862068,0.2816754576610609,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

4. **give_tip**: Identify suggestions or advice not directly instructing the user on a specific action, e.g., ""If you don’t see the email, please check your spam folder.""

5. **confirm_process**: Define this category for confirming a process will occur, without providing additional instructions, such as ""Your refund is being processed.""

7. **close_conversation**: Use this for messages that explicitly indicate the end of an interaction, whether or not they contain gratitude, like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **resolve_issue**: Consolidate statements related to solutions and timelines for resolving issues, such as ""The refund will be processed in 3-5 days"" and ""We can offer you a replacement.""

17,feedback_1,"Categorize each interaction based on its intent or action with the following guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Ensure similar expressions are consistently categorized under the same intent:
   - ""close_conversation"": Use for expressions that conclude the interaction (e.g., ""Glad I could help!"", ""You’re very welcome!"", ""Take care!"", ""Thank you for reaching out!"")

2. **Disambiguate Gratitude and Solution Confirmation**: Differentiate between gratitude and solution confirmation, even if they appear together:
   - ""confirm_solution"": Focus on verifying the solution worked (e.g., ""Yes, that worked."")
   - ""express_gratitude"": Focus on thankfulness (e.g., ""Thanks for your help!"")

3. **Utilize Contextual Cues for Assistants**: Identify the primary purpose of assistant messages through context:
   - ""provide_refund_timeline"": Specific information about refund timing (e.g., ""Your refund will be processed in 3-5 days."")
   - ""reassure_customer"": General reassurance without specific timelines (e.g., ""We’re here to help with any issues."")

4. **Maintain Consistent Categorization**: Ensure distinct intents remain separate:
   - ""ask_order_number"": Direct request for order details (e.g., ""Can you provide your order number?"")
   - ""reassure_customer"": Comforting messages (e.g., ""Don't worry, we’ll sort this out."")

5. **Expand Closing Intent Examples**: Include a variety of closing phrases under ""close_conversation"":
   - Examples: ""Have a great day!"", ""Talk to you soon!"", ""You're welcome, anytime!""

6. **Differentiate Between Requests and Instructions**: Clarify distinctions between requests and inquiries:
   - ""request_order_number"": Direct request (e.g., ""Please give me your order number."")
   - ""ask_order_number"": More general inquiry (e.g., ""Could I have your order number?"")

7. **Illustrate Overlapping Intents**: Provide scenarios where intents transition:
   - Example: From ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the dialogue wraps up.

8. **Prioritize Message Purpose**: Focus on the main intent when gratitude and confirmation coexist:
   - ""confirm_solution"": When the main purpose is verifying success (e.g., ""Yes, that's fixed. Thanks!"")

18,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.4430388052552682,0.9128787878787878,0.3555555555555555,0.4044407275246955,"[18. 22. 15.  4. 13.  2. 16.  9. 11.  7.  3. 21. 15.  8. 17.  0. 12.  9.

20,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

22,feedback_1,"Classify each statement as either ""customer"" or ""assistant"" and provide a corresponding intent label.

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding, agreement, or readiness to proceed.
   - Example: ""Okay, thanks for checking."" or ""Perfect, I’ll try that now.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

6. **Provide Refund Timeline**: Informing about the duration for processing a refund.
   - Example: ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days.""

7. **Request Order Number**: Asking the customer to provide their order number.
   - Example: ""Can you share the order number with me?""

8. **Confirm Issue**: Verifying or clarifying the problem or concern presented.
   - Example: ""So, the item was damaged on arrival?""

9. **Give Tip**: Offering helpful suggestions without detailed steps.
   - Example: ""It might help to restart your device.""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases can signal readiness to proceed or confirm understanding.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.
- Maintain separate intents for messages that convey different actions or requests, even if they appear in quick succession.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Encourage ongoing review and refinement based on new data or ambiguous cases.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for users to flag difficult-to-classify messages for further analysis and definition adjustment.",6.0,,,0.4699180112633404,0.5492063492063491,0.3855421686746987,0.2580819553922472,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

23,feedback_1,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Follow these refined guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Provide clear definitions to differentiate similar intents:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without explicit gratitude. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Strengthen differentiation cues for intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"". Explicit gratitude terms such as ""thanks"" or ""appreciate"" should be categorized as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Maintain uniformity in labeling similar responses. For instance, both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should be labeled as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Provide clear instructions for messages with multiple intents. Decide whether to split into separate intents or choose a primary one, e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" could be split into ""Acknowledge"" and ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between overlapping intents like ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For example, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be categorized as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Use context to interpret ambiguous phrases, ensuring specificity. For instance, differentiate ""offer_alternative_updates"" from ""explain_issue"" by context in messages like ""I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives.""

8. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Emphasize the importance of regularly updating intent categories to reflect changes in customer interaction patterns, minimizing errors like ""false_merge"" and ""false_split"".

9. **Illustrate with Error Examples:**
   - Use specific examples to illustrate common mistakes and corrections. For instance, separate ""Great, how long will the refund take?"" from ""ask_order_number"" to clarify distinct intents.

By implementing these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and consistency of intent categorization in customer service interactions.",7.0,,,0.3406907170441308,0.6316205533596838,0.2972972972972973,0.2151872592239213,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

0,warm_start,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiating between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some refined guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:**
   - Example: Differentiate ""assistant: Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed."" (intent: confirm_issue) from ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" (intent: acknowledge).

2. **Avoid False Merges:**
   - Example: Distinguish ""customer: That’s helpful, thanks!"" (intent: express_gratitude) from ""customer: Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" (intent: confirm_solution).

3. **Standardize Instructional Language:**
   - Example: Separate ""assistant: If you don’t see the email, please check your spam folder."" (intent: give_tip) from ""assistant: I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives."" (intent: offer_alternative_updates).

4. **Consistent Recognition of Similar Intents:**
   - Example: Ensure consistency in labeling ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" as (intent: close_conversation).

5. **Refine Request Differentiation:**
   - Example: Use consistent labeling for ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" as (intent: request_order_number).

6. **Disambiguate Similar Yet Distinct Intents:**
   - Example: Differentiate ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" (intent: offer_additional_help) from ""assistant: I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives."" (intent: offer_alternative_updates).

7. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Example: Understand context to differentiate ""offer_additional_help"" from ""give_tip,"" ensuring accurate capture of message purposes.

8. **Reinforce Intent Consistency:**
   - Example: Maintain consistent labeling for intents such as ""close_conversation,"" even with slight phrasings like ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!""

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

3,warm_start,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",,,,0.5226651228327732,0.9039226080042408,0.4666666666666667,0.4724488209438572,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

4,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiating between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some refined guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Enhance Recognition of Similar Phrasings for Consistent Intents:**
   - Consistently label expressions of gratitude such as ""Okay, thanks for the advice,"" ""Got it, thanks,"" and ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" as (intent: express_gratitude).

2. **Differentiate Closely Related Intents:**
   - Emphasize recognizing specific actions or agreements to differentiate intents like ""provide_payment_method"" and ""agree_to_try."" For example, distinguish ""With a credit card"" from ""I’ll try PayPal.""

3. **Clarify Intent Boundaries for Endings and Closures:**
   - Reinforce the difference between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation,"" distinguishing messages like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" from ""Great. Have a wonderful day!""

4. **Use Consistent Terminology for Similar Actions:**
   - Standardize intent labels like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" as (intent: offer_solution).

5. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Highlight the importance of context to differentiate similar intents like ""offer_additional_help"" and ""offer_alternative_updates.""

6. **Standardize Language for Common Requests:**
   - Use consistent intent labeling for requests such as ""request_order_number"" by recognizing similar phrasing.

7. **Reinforce Consistency in Closing Statements:**
   - Ensure that intents like ""close_conversation"" are consistently applied to varied phrasings like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **Disambiguate Errors and Solutions:**
   - Clarify the separation between describing an error and agreeing to a solution, as seen in messages like ""Yes, it said 'transaction declined'"" and ""I’ll try PayPal.""

By focusing on these areas, the intent discovery process can produce more accurate and meaningful clusters, reducing instances of both false splits and merges.",0.0,,,0.4251179299910477,0.6839569160997733,0.448,0.2907623483753963,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

5,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Stress the importance of distinguishing between expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" and standalone gratitude expressions like ""Thank you for helping me,"" unless part of a closing dialogue.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide examples to differentiate similar intents like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be primarily labeled as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Emphasize consistency when clustering acknowledgments. Use context to decide if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped together or separately, depending on the specific action each acknowledgment implies.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Illustrate when multiple intents are present in a single message. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should encompass both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance.""

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Encourage using the surrounding conversation context to accurately determine intents. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number"" based on the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

By adhering to these guidelines, ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing the likelihood of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.5866176001462057,0.9064625850340136,0.6375,0.5317469062549789,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

6,feedback_0,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content. 

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly distinguish intents such as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude."" Use ""close_conversation"" for messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" which aim to conclude an interaction.

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Provide distinct categories for similar intents. For instance, separate ""ask_order_number"" (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"") as they seek different information.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Ensure all expressions of thanks are consistently categorized under ""express_gratitude,"" such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use context to differentiate similar intents like ""provide_new_address"" (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."") from ""provide_guidance"" (e.g., ""If the card still fails later, contact your bank for details."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Specify when to split or merge intents based on differences, such as separating ""confirm_action"" (e.g., ""I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent."") from ""confirm_overcharge"" (e.g., ""You were indeed charged twice for delivery."").

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents like ""report_payment_failure"" (e.g., ""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"").

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing ""accept_solution"" (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders."").

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents, such as differentiating ""describe_issue"" (e.g., ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders.""). 

By following these guidelines, enhance the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.4532005658934174,0.8261070526695526,0.4508196721311475,0.3743921837583844,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

7,feedback_0,"### Improved Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",3.0,,,0.7327216376763207,0.9560090702947844,0.7560975609756097,0.7004885316198113,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

8,feedback_1,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, accurately identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, clearly distinguishing between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are refined guidelines and examples to assist you:

1. **Consistent Recognition for Acknowledgment:**
   - Ensure that acknowledgment expressions like ""Perfect, I’ll try that now,"" ""Okay, let me check,"" and ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are consistently labeled as (intent: acknowledge).

2. **Differentiate Information Requests and Solution Offers:**
   - Clearly differentiate intents such as ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" from ""offer_solution."" For example, distinguish ""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"" from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

3. **Refine Problem Reporting vs. Update Requests:**
   - Precisely differentiate intents like ""report_billing_issue"" from ""request_update_address."" For instance, distinguish ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" from ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address.""

4. **Standardize Intent Labeling for Similar Actions:**
   - Recognize similar phrasing for actions like ""offer_solution,"" such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account.""

5. **Clarify Boundaries for Similar Requests:**
   - Reinforce differentiation between similar intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"" with clear examples, such as ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" versus ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

6. **Disambiguate Confirming Actions vs. Reassuring Customers:**
   - Highlight the difference between ""confirm_action"" and ""reassure_customer."" For example, differentiate ""Perfect, I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent to your address"" from ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot.""

7. **Standardize Language for Gratitude and Closures:**
   - Consistently apply intent labels like ""close_conversation"" to varied phrasings such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!""

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding for Similar Intents:**
   - Emphasize context to distinguish similar intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""explain_issue."" For instance, contrast ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" with ""Thank you. I see the order is on its way, but the tracking system is delayed.""

9,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Evaluate the role of each message in the conversation to correctly identify its intent. For example, in a billing issue context, ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" should be understood as ""offer_solution.""

- **Refine Instructions for Distinguishing Closing Statements:** Differentiate between expressions that close a conversation and those that offer gratitude. For instance, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" should be categorized as ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s everything"" should be recognized as ""end_request.""

- **Improve Differentiation of Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples to distinguish similar intents, such as ""provide_refund_timeline"" versus general refund information. Statements like ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should fall under ""provide_refund_timeline.""

- **Incorporate Examples for Disambiguating Instructions and Solutions:** Use examples like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" for ""offer_solution"" and ""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen"" for ""provide_instructions.""

- **Highlight the Need for Consistent Acknowledgment Clustering:** Use context to decide whether acknowledgment phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" should be combined into a single intent or kept separate.

- **Address Multi-Intent Messages Clearly:** Illustrate how to handle messages with multiple intents. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" should be recognized as ""offer_solution"" and potentially involve other intents depending on the broader query.

- **Provide Clear Guidelines for Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents exist within a single message and classify them accurately without false merges.

- **Include Examples of Gratitude as a Distinct Intent:** Demonstrate situations where gratitude should be a standalone intent, such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" to prevent incorrect merges with other intents.

By implementing these guidelines, ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing the likelihood of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.2833505640445911,0.8491842624495686,0.2005277044854881,0.2406168397428753,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

10,feedback_1,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content.

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly define each intent with examples. Use ""close_conversation"" for statements intended to end an interaction, such as ""Have a great day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Differentiate from ""express_gratitude,"" which includes expressions like ""Thank you for the help.""

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Create distinct categories for intents that are contextually different. For example, ""request_order_number"" involves asking for an order number, such as ""Can you share the order number with me?"" while ""ask_order_number"" might be used in different contexts.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Group similar expressions under the same intent consistently. For instance, all expressions of gratitude, including ""Perfect, thank you for the help,"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate between similar intents. For example, distinguish ""provide_instructions"" (""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen."") from ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by the nature of the message.

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Provide clear criteria for when to split or merge intents. For instance, differentiate ""confirm_solution"" (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"") from ""express_gratitude"" based on the action or confirmation involved.

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents. For instance, distinguish ""report_payment_failure"" (""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (""Did you receive any error message?"") with context on the inquiry.

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing intents like ""accept_solution"" (""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (""Please for all future orders."") to ensure clarity.

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Train the model to understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents. For example, differentiate ""describe_issue"" (""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" by analyzing the surrounding context.

By following these guidelines, improve the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.3875018203734508,0.7008092715723595,0.3928571428571429,0.2715648684688814,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

11,feedback_1,"### Refined Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This involves tagging each response with a specific intent label to effectively guide the conversation. Follow these enhanced instructions for precise intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Define each intent clearly and provide examples to prevent confusion. For instance, differentiate between ""confirm_update"" and ""confirm_overcharge"" with examples such as ""Done, your profile has been updated"" for ""confirm_update"" and ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" for ""confirm_overcharge.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For example, consistently tag ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as ""close_conversation"" to avoid splitting into ""end_request"" or ""close_conversation"" based on minor wording variations.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how context can alter a message's intent. For instance, differentiate ""I’ll try PayPal"" as ""agree_to_try"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" as ""acknowledge,"" using context to guide intent recognition.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid unnecessary granularity unless it aligns with business objectives. For example, decide when to split intents like ""provide_instructions"" and ""provide_guidance"" based on their business significance.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Offer detailed examples of false merges to clarify intent distinctions. For instance, distinguish ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address"" as ""request_update_address"" from ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield"" as ""provide_new_address.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Group intents based on broader goals. Ensure all phrases aiming to close a conversation are tagged under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of wording differences.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Suggest strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as using previous interactions to differentiate intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation."" Clarify when ""No, that’s everything"" should be an ""end_request"" versus ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include diverse examples, particularly from error cases, to guide correct categorization. Differentiate intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by considering scenarios where context determines the intent, such as offering a refund versus suggesting a fix.

By applying these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and consistency of intent identification in customer service interactions, enhancing the overall customer experience.",3.0,,,0.4928677186328189,0.9332563213964832,0.4065040650406503,0.4599719140263414,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",,,,0.6402509353401891,0.922481612966042,0.6461538461538462,0.5906197155356346,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",,,,0.3989429219702807,0.7985149308618041,0.4351145038167939,0.3185618797549048,"[73.  7. 32. 84. 21. 33. 48.  2. 20. 39. 19. 69.  8. 31. 84. 40. 44.  1.

2,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on merging intents that serve similar functions. For example, combine ""acknowledge_and_thank"" with ""express_gratitude"" unless there are explicit reasons to keep them separate. Use examples such as ""customer: Okay, I’ll do that now. Thanks for your support!"" and ""customer: Perfect, thank you for the help."" to illustrate this consolidation.

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases to avoid false splits. For instance, ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be tagged as ""accept_solution."" Use these phrases to demonstrate the importance of consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how conversation context can alter intent interpretation. For example, ""Okay, let me check."" can imply ""acknowledge"" or ""accept_solution"" depending on preceding messages. Use examples like ""customer: That would be good."" and ""customer: Oh, I didn’t realize."" to show context's impact on intent.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions unless necessary for business objectives. Illustrate this by addressing errors such as tagging ""provide_refund_timeline"" and ""provide_instructions"" separately without clear differentiation.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to show how context alters intent, preventing false merges. For instance, differentiate ""customer: Awesome, appreciate the help!"" from ""customer: Perfect, thank you."" as ""express_gratitude"" and ""accept_solution"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their overarching goal. For example, all phrases related to closing should fall under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of specific wording. Use examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" to emphasize this point.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as analyzing the conversation stage or prior interactions. For example, differentiate between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation"" based on whether further action is implied.

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a wider range of examples to cover common pitfalls. For instance, differentiate ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_overcharge"" with scenarios like ""customer: I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.3180827175924228,0.7218621463737009,0.2480286738351254,0.229611873245646,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they appear in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""close_conversation"".

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" fall under ""acknowledge"" or if they indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" as ""provide_order_number"" if they respond to a request for an order number.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they serve a dual purpose.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.3768676215114094,0.681635416368167,0.4010791366906475,0.2568863181046104,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on when to merge intents and when to keep them distinct. Combine intents that express similar functions, such as gratitude or closure, unless the context significantly changes their meaning. For example, merge ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help!"" under ""close_conversation"".

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases by using specific examples. For instance, ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both be tagged as ""express_gratitude"". Highlight these to stress the importance of uniformity in tagging similar expressions.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Clearly illustrate how context can change intent interpretation. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" could mean ""provide_order_number"" if followed by order-related queries. Use such examples to show how preceding messages can shift intent, preventing errors like false merges.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions that do not serve a clear business purpose. For example, differentiate between ""provide_item_details"" and ""describe_error_message"" only when necessary. Ensure clarity in examples like ""Yes, it says my password is incorrect."" versus ""A carton of milk."" to prevent incorrect merges.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to illustrate how seemingly similar intents may require separation. For example, do not merge ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s FREEDELIVERY."" as they represent ""provide_order_number"" and ""provide_voucher_code"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their ultimate goal, such as merging all closing phrases under ""close_conversation"". This prevents false splits seen in examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""You’re very welcome!"", which should be unified under a single intent.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer practical strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation stage or examining previous interactions. For example, differentiate intents like ""confirm_refund"" and ""provide_payment_method"" based on context, seen in ""Refund has been processed."" versus ""With a credit card.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a broader range of examples that capture common pitfalls. Differentiate between ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" using scenarios such as ""I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential errors.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.6268253842488088,0.9031630258115054,0.6115288220551379,0.5661255106936137,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they follow a gratitude expression in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""express_gratitude"" unless used to conclude the exchange.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" are acknowledgments or indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context and surrounding conversation.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" as ""provide_order_number"" only if it responds to a request for an order number. Ensure that context is considered in scenarios where intent might be ambiguous.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they are part of a dual-purpose exchange.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.4376941079486332,0.7372108438517107,0.4864341085271318,0.3226728426697336,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_0,"Categorize each interaction between a customer and an assistant by examining both the wording and the context to determine the true intent or purpose of the message. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Recognize when messages should be grouped under a single intent versus when they should be split. Variations in phrasing do not indicate different intents if the underlying purpose is the same. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" both serve the intent of ""close_conversation"".

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Focus on the specific issue or action being described, rather than general similarities. Identify unique aspects of the message content that signal different intents, such as distinguishing between ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Identify common phrases that share the same intent despite appearing different. For example, ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" and ""Got it, thanks."" both express ""express_gratitude"".

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual cues to identify the broader intent, such as offering further assistance or closing the conversation. Messages like ""Happy to help! Anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both offer ""offer_additional_help"".

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Recognize that complex interactions may involve multiple distinct intents. Break down messages to discern different stages or aspects of the conversation, such as distinguishing ""report_problem"" from ""confirm_attempted_solution"".

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Look for specific problem descriptions that differentiate intents, even when they seem related. For example, ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."" and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be separate as ""describe_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

By following these guidelines, you can accurately categorize each interaction to improve the clustering accuracy of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3309779514644528,0.7885051456480029,0.3107569721115538,0.260977817825756,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

5,feedback_0,"Classify the given text into one of the predefined categories based on its intended outcome. 

**Guidelines:**
1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate similar intents. For example, phrases like ""You're welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should be grouped under ""close_conversation,"" whereas ""Thank you"" belongs to ""express_gratitude.""
   
2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Focus on the distinct action or response expected. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" should be categorized as ""confirm_update,"" while ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" falls under ""confirm_overcharge.""

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Look for keywords indicating a question (e.g., ""Could you,"" ""Can you"") versus a statement (e.g., ""You can,"" ""It is possible"") to differentiate intents like ""ask_new_address"" and ""provide_guidance.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Recognize that different phrasings can map to the same intent. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" both belong to ""close_conversation.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Consider the context and the action or reassurance being communicated. For example, ""Yes, you’ll receive an email"" should be ""confirm_process,"" while ""If you don’t see the email"" should be ""give_tip.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Identify the primary action or request. For example, ""Got it. Do you want to apply this change"" is a request for confirmation, while ""Hi, I can’t track my order"" indicates a request for assistance.

6,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

7,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts. Ensure accurate clustering by considering the following:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" with examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Differentiate between similar intents by recognizing nuances, such as ""confirm_issue"" (e.g., ""Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed."") versus ""acknowledge"" (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."").

3. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:** Consider the context in which a message is sent. For example, distinguish between requesting information (""Can you share the order number with me?"") and confirming a solution (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"").

4. **Standardize Intent Definitions:** Use consistent definitions for each intent, such as ""express_gratitude,"" with examples like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Perfect, thank you for the help.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Phrasing:** Recognize solution-related intents despite varied phrasing, such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues:** Distinguish between similar closing phrases using context and speaker roles, such as ""Have a great day."" (closing conversation) versus ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (ending a request).

8,feedback_1,"Determine the true intent or purpose of each interaction between a customer and an assistant by analyzing both the wording and context. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Group messages with the same underlying purpose, regardless of phrasing differences. For example, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" share the ""close_conversation"" intent. Focus on the core purpose behind the wording.

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Examine the specific content and action described to identify distinct intents, even for similar messages. Differentiate between intents like ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" by determining if the goal is to clarify a general issue or request specific information.

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Recognize phrases that, despite different wording, share the same intent. For instance, ""Okay, let me check."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both indicate ""acknowledge"" and should be grouped under this intent.

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to understand broader intents, such as concluding an interaction or offering further help. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Take care!"" both indicate a ""close_conversation"" intent.

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Break down complex interactions into multiple intents. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be separated into ""apologize"" and ""ask_order_number"" to reflect different conversation stages.

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Focus on specific details that separate intents, even if they seem related. Distinguish between ""confirm_update"" and ""provide_order_number"" by identifying the specific action or information being confirmed or provided.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Differentiate between intents with distinct purposes using contextual cues. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account."" should be categorized under ""offer_solution"" as they both involve problem-solving actions.

2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Identify unique actions to prevent incorrect merging of intents. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" is ""confirm_update,"" while ""I’ll try PayPal"" involves ""agree_to_try,"" reflecting different intents.

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Use specific keywords or phrases to distinguish inquiries from guidance. For example, ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" is ""reassure_customer,"" while ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" is ""provide_instructions.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Group expressions with similar sentiments under the same intent. For instance, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should be categorized as ""offer_additional_help.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Recognize the context and intent behind each message. For example, ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should be ""provide_refund_timeline,"" while ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" should be ""reassure_customer.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Focus on the primary action or request in the message. For example, ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card"" is a ""report_problem,"" and ""Hi, I can’t track my order in the app"" is a ""report_tracking_issue.""

10,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction by analyzing the context and action taken.

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group expressions conveying similar sentiments under a unified intent. For example, map ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide guidance to distinguish between actions with different intents. For example, use `ask_new_address` for ""Could you provide me with the new address?"" and `ask_payment_method` for ""Was this with a credit card or PayPal?"".

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Promote precise intent identification even when messages seem similar. Classify ""Okay, let me check."" as `acknowledge` and ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. Classify ""Perfect, thank you for the help."" as `express_gratitude`, while ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be labeled as `acknowledge`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for dealing with messages containing multiple intents, ensuring each intent is identified. For instance, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure messages with similar outcomes are consistently labeled. For example, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual information to disambiguate similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify intent definitions to avoid overlaps and ensure distinct categorization. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation`, while ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be `end_request`.

9. **Reinforce the Importance of Contextual Understanding:** Emphasize understanding the conversation context to accurately assign intents. For instance, distinguish between ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order."" as `report_billing_issue` and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" as `report_payment_failure`.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize grouping similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" to avoid false splits. For example, phrases like ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" and ""You too! Take care."" should consistently be categorized together.

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Highlight specific language cues to differentiate between similar intents. For instance, distinguish ""ask_clarification"" (""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"") from ""request_order_number"" (""Can you share the order number with me?"").

1,warm_start,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

By following these guidelines, ensure accurate and consistent classification of customer support messages based on their true intents.",,,,0.5220225073971582,0.8842336482615645,0.5127582017010935,0.4615898661904387,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

2,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Use clear examples to illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent to avoid false splits. For instance, ensure phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" are consistently categorized under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Similar Intents:** Provide detailed examples to distinguish closely related intents. Differentiate between ""ask_voucher_code"" and ""ask_order_number"" with specific language cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Reinforce the importance of understanding the conversation context to correctly identify intents. Recognize intents like ""diagnose_issue"" versus ""offer_compensation"" by understanding the broader service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear and consistent examples for each intent to prevent confusion. Ensure phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are always classified as ""acknowledge.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Offer guidance on identifying solution-related intents, ensuring different phrasings are recognized under the same intent. For example, both ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll manually add the points to your account now"" should be categorized under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of context and speaker roles to distinguish similar closing phrases and intents. Differentiate between ""close_conversation"" and ""end_request"" by examining the speaker and context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for more granular categorization, especially in broader intent categories. Provide examples of sub-intents, such as distinguishing ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3627834722431216,0.7128959682418796,0.3486943164362518,0.2586268747069112,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly differentiate between intents with similar functions. For example, distinguish between `ask_error_details` (""Sorry to hear that! Are you getting an error message?"") and `request_receipt_number` (""Can you share your receipt number?"").

2. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle differences in context or phrasing to accurately classify intents. For example, differentiate between `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") and `acknowledge` (""Got it, thanks."").

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Use consistent labels for messages leading to the same outcome. For instance, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome"" should be classified as `close_conversation`.

4. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents in a single message. For example, ""You’re welcome. I’ll keep tracking your order until it’s delivered,"" should include both `express_gratitude` and `confirm_followup`.

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to avoid false splits. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should map to `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. For instance, distinguish ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`) from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`).

7. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate intents that might seem similar. For example, separate `ask_new_address` from `report_voucher_issue` to avoid misclassification.

8. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Clarify and redefine overlapping intents to improve accuracy. For example, separate `end_request` (""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"") from `close_conversation` (""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."").

4,feedback_1,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent with examples. For instance, categorize phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" consistently under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Clarify Intent Distinctions with Examples:** Use specific examples to highlight subtle differences between closely related intents. Differentiate ""ask_voucher_code"" from ""ask_order_number"" with cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Stress the importance of understanding the broader conversation context to accurately identify intents. For example, distinguish ""diagnose_issue"" from ""offer_compensation"" by recognizing the specific service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear examples to ensure consistent intent classification. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" should always be classified under ""acknowledge,"" while ""Perfect, thank you"" should be under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Guide the recognition of solution-related intents by categorizing different phrasings under the same intent. For instance, ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" should fall under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of speaker roles and context to distinguish similar closing phrases. Differentiate ""close_conversation"" from ""end_request"" by identifying whether the speaker is the customer or assistant and examining the conversation context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for granular categorization within broader intents. Distinguish ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank"" by recognizing when gratitude is expressed standalone versus when it accompanies acknowledgment of a solution.

8. **Encourage Use of Speaker Context:** Stress the importance of identifying the speaker (customer or assistant) to accurately classify intents, particularly in mixed dialogues. This helps avoid errors like merging intents that belong to different roles, such as ""describe_issue"" and ""confirm_overcharge.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages for improved intent discovery and reduced errors.",0.0,,,0.3392932480499438,0.6273454689869914,0.2936630602782071,0.2128540818220116,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly define and differentiate between intents with similar functions. For instance, distinguish between `acknowledge` (""Okay, let me check."") and `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") to avoid confusion and ensure precise clustering.

2. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents within a single message. For example, in ""No worries, resetting usually solves this problem. Would you like me to guide you through it?"", recognize both `offer_solution` and `offer_assistance`.

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Ensure that similar messages consistently lead to the same intent label. For example, both ""Appreciate the help!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should be labeled as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle contextual differences to enhance precision in intent classification. Distinguish between `report_problem` (""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."") and `report_login_issue` (""Hi, I can’t log in to the app anymore."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to prevent false splits. Ensure that ""Much appreciated!"" and ""Thanks, that works."" are categorized under `express_gratitude`.

6. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate overlapping intents. For instance, clearly separate `request_update_address` from `report_forgot_password` to avoid misclassification.

7. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Provide distinct definitions for overlapping intent categories to enhance classification accuracy. For example, differentiate between `provide_refund_timeline` and `explain_reason` for refund-related messages.

8. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. Distinguish between ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`) and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`).

9. **Incorporate Disambiguation Cues:** Add cues or examples to help distinguish often-confused intents. Differentiate between `offer_additional_help` (""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"") and `offer_solution` (""Would you like me to issue you a different voucher?"") using scenario-based examples.

3,feedback_0,"When assigning a label to each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Recognize messages that share the same intent despite different expressions, while also distinguishing messages with distinct purposes. Use context and the flow of conversation to guide your labeling decisions. 

- **Identify Similar Intents**: Look for messages that express the same intent using different words (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both convey 'acknowledge'). Group these under the same intent.

- **Emphasize Granularity**: Analyze the specific actions or information conveyed. Differentiate messages that appear related but serve different functions (e.g., ""Open the app, tap “Forgot password”, and follow the steps."" vs. ""It was SAVE20."").

- **Differentiate Actions**: Recognize messages with distinct actions or outcomes (e.g., ""I’ve added a $10 voucher to your account."" vs. ""Done. The points are now visible in your balance."") and label them separately.

- **Use Contextual Cues**: Consider the context and conversational flow to determine the intent (e.g., ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" both function as 'close_conversation').

- **Distinguish Similar Responses**: Differentiate between responses with similar wording but different intents (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" vs. ""That’s helpful, thanks!"") by considering their function.

- **Create Comprehensive Labels**: Develop labels that capture both the action and context of the message, ensuring specificity and descriptiveness (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."" needs a distinct label from ""A carton of milk."").

- **Balance Specificity and Generalization**: Find a balance in label specificity. Use broader categories when appropriate, but maintain specificity when messages have distinct intents (e.g., ""I see. What voucher code are you trying to use?"" vs. ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"").

By following these guidelines, you'll improve your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, enhancing the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.2866114621833696,0.824207215844252,0.2334455667789001,0.2362272352752052,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"Classify each input according to the following refined list of intents, taking into account the context and the role of the speaker (customer vs. assistant). Pay special attention to distinguishing between closely related intents and understanding the nuances of each category:

1. **report_wrong_order**: Identifying issues with a received order.
2. **report_missing_receipt**: Notifying about the absence of a receipt.
3. **suggest_troubleshooting**: Offering solutions to resolve an issue.
4. **acknowledge**: Recognizing or validating a statement or concern. Note that acknowledgment may coexist with gratitude but should be identified as distinct when acknowledging an action or solution.
5. **explain_reason**: Providing explanations for a situation or decision.
6. **describe_issue**: Detailing a specific problem or concern.
7. **request_replacement**: Asking for a new item in place of a faulty one.
8. **express_gratitude**: Thanking or showing appreciation. Differentiate from accepting solutions or closing conversations when gratitude is the primary intent.
9. **provide_order_number**: Supplying a reference or order number.
10. **close_conversation**: Ending the interaction. Identify when this overlaps with gratitude or other intents and determine which is predominant.
11. **accept_solution**: Agreeing to a proposed resolution. Distinguish from mere expressions of satisfaction or gratitude.
12. **offer_compensation**: Proposing a benefit as reparation.
13. **confirm_action**: Verifying that a task has been completed. Differentiate from offering solutions or confirming follow-ups.
14. **offer_discount**: Providing a price reduction as a goodwill gesture.
15. **confirm_followup**: Assuring ongoing tracking or future actions. Differentiate from confirming immediate actions.
16. **ask_payment_method**: Inquiring about the payment type used.
17. **ask_new_timeslot**: Requesting a preferred time for scheduling.
18. **provide_guidance**: Giving instructions or advice on how to proceed. Differentiate when both suggesting alternatives and providing guidance are involved.

Consider the intent's predominant purpose, context, and speaker role, ensuring that similar intents are grouped and differentiated accurately. Use examples to guide the classification, highlight common pitfalls, and provide corrective examples to avoid errors such as false splits and merges in intent classification.",0.0,,,0.3206978324821099,0.4225476791566757,0.2803418803418804,0.1355101248258919,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"When labeling each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by carefully examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Here are key guidelines to assist in accurate intent discovery:

1. **Clarify Intent Identification**:
   - Identify messages that convey the same intent despite different expressions (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be labeled as 'accept_solution'). Emphasize recognizing varied phrasing for similar intents.

2. **Enhance Differentiation of Actions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between messages with different actions or outcomes (e.g., ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."" should be labeled 'report_problem', while ""Yes, I tried both. Still doesn't work."" should be 'confirm_attempted_solution').

3. **Highlight the Need for Granularity**:
   - Focus on specific actions or outcomes in messages (e.g., ""You’re very welcome! Let me know if you need more help after resetting."" should be 'offer_followup' and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be 'end_request').

4. **Encourage Contextual Analysis**:
   - Use context and conversation flow to determine intent (e.g., ""I understand, that must be frustrating. Have you tried rescanning it or adding it to the app?"" should be 'suggest_troubleshooting', and ""Thanks. That code is only valid for orders above $50."" should be 'explain_restriction').

5. **Improve Label Specificity**:
   - Create labels that encapsulate both the action and context (e.g., ""Done, your profile has been updated."" should have a distinct label from ""Got it. I’ve updated your delivery slot to 6–8 pm."" by considering the specific updates being confirmed).

6. **Balance Specificity and Generalization**:
   - Find a balance between broad and specific categories (e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Thanks, that works."" should consistently be labeled as 'express_gratitude' to avoid false splits).

7. **Distinguish Function in Similar Responses**:
   - Differentiate responses with similar wording but different functions (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" should be labeled 'accept_solution', while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be 'express_gratitude', based on their contextual function).

By integrating these guidelines, you'll enhance your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, improving the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.3597713988131546,0.688632331720567,0.3021690351533284,0.2477502172510727,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

   - ""express_gratitude"": Expressions of thankfulness (e.g., ""Thank you so much!"")

2. **Provide Examples for Disambiguation**: Use examples to distinguish intents:
   - ""Okay, thanks for checking."" (acknowledge)
   - ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" (express_gratitude)

3. **Emphasize Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to distinguish intents, especially in assistant messages:
   - ""close_conversation"": When the conversation is ending (e.g., ""Take care!"")
   - ""offer_additional_help"": When further assistance is offered (e.g., ""Is there anything else I can do for you?"")

4. **Reinforce Intent Consistency**: Maintain consistent categorization for similar intents to avoid splits:
   - ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" should consistently be categorized under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Highlight Specificity in Instructions**: Be specific when categorizing requests or instructions:
   - ""request_order_number"": Specific request for the order number (e.g., ""Can you share the order number with me?"")
   - ""ask_order_number"": General inquiry for the order number (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"")

6. **Encourage Flexibility in Interpretation**: Allow flexibility for variations in phrasing to ensure accurate categorization:
   - ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" may accommodate slight variations in phrasing while maintaining their distinct categories.

7. **Include Common Closing Phrases**: Group common closing phrases under ""close_conversation"" for consistent classification:
   - Examples include ""Thank you for reaching out!"" and ""Have a great day!""

8. **Provide More Contextual Scenarios**: Expand on typical conversation flows to illustrate how intents may transition or overlap:
   - For example, moving from ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the interaction concludes.

10,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between intents such as ""request_order_number"" (where a customer is explicitly asking for their order number) and ""ask_order_number"" (where a customer might be inquiring if they need to provide their order number).

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Recognize that similar phrases often share the same intent. For example, phrases like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation."" Maintain consistency across similar expressions.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Understand that different phrases can convey the same intent. For instance, ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should both be categorized under the ""acknowledge"" intent.

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use contextual cues to distinguish between intents. For example, the intent behind ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (likely ""close_conversation"") differs from ""No, that’s all"" (possibly ""end_request"") based on conversation context.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Aim for a balanced level of granularity. Avoid overly detailed distinctions like ""request_order_number"" vs. ""ask_order_number"" unless necessary for specific business goals.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Use examples such as ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" to illustrate how similar queries can reflect different intents, such as ""apology"" versus ""request_order_number,"" depending on context and phrasing.

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents based on the underlying goal of the message. For instance, all forms of closing statements should be under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Implement strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.3808945168581792,0.7729468599033816,0.3720930232558139,0.2944112207599453,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

12,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group expressions that close a conversation together, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from standalone expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me.""

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Differentiate between gratitude and confirmation. For example, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be seen as a ""confirm_solution"" followed by ""express_gratitude,"" whereas ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" primarily expresses gratitude.

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Maintain consistency in grouping similar acknowledgments. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped based on context unless differentiated by specific actions.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents are present within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" which offers help and seeks further engagement.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use conversation context to determine intents, such as classifying both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" under ""provide_order_number.""

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges, using examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to show when gratitude is a distinct intent.

13,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiate between closely related intents, and use consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Identify Similar Intents:**
   - Example: ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!"" both have the intent: close_conversation.

2. **Differentiate Close Intents:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" has the intent: express_gratitude, while ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge.

3. **Consistent Language Use:**
   - Use standardized terminology for similar requests, such as ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" both having the intent: request_order_number.

4. **Encourage Intent Grouping:**
   - Example: ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""assistant: Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both have the intent: offer_additional_help.

5. **Refine Acknowledgment vs. Gratitude:**
   - Example: ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" has the intent: acknowledge, while ""customer: Got it, thanks."" has the intent: express_gratitude.

6. **Disambiguate Instructional Content:**
   - Example: ""assistant: No worries. You can reset it by tapping “Forgot password” on the login screen."" and ""assistant: Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English."" both have the intent: provide_instructions.

7. **Highlight Intent Continuity:**
   - Example: ""customer: No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" and ""customer: No, that’s all."" both have the intent: end_request.

14,feedback_0,"Classify each statement as either ""customer"" or ""assistant"" and provide a corresponding intent label. 

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding or agreement, often with neutral responses.
   - Example: ""Okay, let me check.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases are often neutral confirmations, while gratitude phrases express thanks.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Cross-reference with other examples to ensure accurate intent classification.
- Incorporate a review step to prevent false merges of distinct intents.",6.0,,,0.2292799157896447,0.5185093167701863,0.1614906832298136,0.1188837724852145,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

15,feedback_0,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Below are guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Clearly differentiate between similar intents, such as:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without further action. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Examples: ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - For intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"", look for explicit gratitude terms to categorize as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Ensure uniformity in labeling similar responses. E.g., categorize both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Decide on a consistent approach for messages like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" Determine if they should be split into separate intents or fall under a broader category like ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For instance, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be marked as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Periodically evaluate and adjust intent categories to ensure they align with evolving customer interaction trends.

8. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Provide specific instructions for phrases that may fit multiple intents. Use context cues to determine the most appropriate intent.

By following these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and clarity of intent categorization in customer service interactions.",7.0,,,0.3644745725009509,0.7728260869565217,0.3103448275862068,0.2816754576610609,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

4. **give_tip**: Identify suggestions or advice not directly instructing the user on a specific action, e.g., ""If you don’t see the email, please check your spam folder.""

5. **confirm_process**: Define this category for confirming a process will occur, without providing additional instructions, such as ""Your refund is being processed.""

7. **close_conversation**: Use this for messages that explicitly indicate the end of an interaction, whether or not they contain gratitude, like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **resolve_issue**: Consolidate statements related to solutions and timelines for resolving issues, such as ""The refund will be processed in 3-5 days"" and ""We can offer you a replacement.""

17,feedback_1,"Categorize each interaction based on its intent or action with the following guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Ensure similar expressions are consistently categorized under the same intent:
   - ""close_conversation"": Use for expressions that conclude the interaction (e.g., ""Glad I could help!"", ""You’re very welcome!"", ""Take care!"", ""Thank you for reaching out!"")

2. **Disambiguate Gratitude and Solution Confirmation**: Differentiate between gratitude and solution confirmation, even if they appear together:
   - ""confirm_solution"": Focus on verifying the solution worked (e.g., ""Yes, that worked."")
   - ""express_gratitude"": Focus on thankfulness (e.g., ""Thanks for your help!"")

3. **Utilize Contextual Cues for Assistants**: Identify the primary purpose of assistant messages through context:
   - ""provide_refund_timeline"": Specific information about refund timing (e.g., ""Your refund will be processed in 3-5 days."")
   - ""reassure_customer"": General reassurance without specific timelines (e.g., ""We’re here to help with any issues."")

4. **Maintain Consistent Categorization**: Ensure distinct intents remain separate:
   - ""ask_order_number"": Direct request for order details (e.g., ""Can you provide your order number?"")
   - ""reassure_customer"": Comforting messages (e.g., ""Don't worry, we’ll sort this out."")

5. **Expand Closing Intent Examples**: Include a variety of closing phrases under ""close_conversation"":
   - Examples: ""Have a great day!"", ""Talk to you soon!"", ""You're welcome, anytime!""

6. **Differentiate Between Requests and Instructions**: Clarify distinctions between requests and inquiries:
   - ""request_order_number"": Direct request (e.g., ""Please give me your order number."")
   - ""ask_order_number"": More general inquiry (e.g., ""Could I have your order number?"")

7. **Illustrate Overlapping Intents**: Provide scenarios where intents transition:
   - Example: From ""offer_additional_help"" to ""close_conversation"" as the dialogue wraps up.

8. **Prioritize Message Purpose**: Focus on the main intent when gratitude and confirmation coexist:
   - ""confirm_solution"": When the main purpose is verifying success (e.g., ""Yes, that's fixed. Thanks!"")

18,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",2.0,,,0.4430388052552682,0.9128787878787878,0.3555555555555555,0.4044407275246955,"[18. 22. 15.  4. 13.  2. 16.  9. 11.  7.  3. 21. 15.  8. 17.  0. 12.  9.

20,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

22,feedback_1,"Classify each statement as either ""customer"" or ""assistant"" and provide a corresponding intent label.

### Intent Definitions:

1. **Provide Instructions**: Offering detailed steps or guidance to accomplish a task.
   - Example: ""To reset your password, click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the prompts.""

2. **Close Conversation**: Indicating the end of an interaction, often with farewell or concluding remarks.
   - Example: ""You too! Take care.""

3. **Offer Additional Help**: Asking if further assistance is needed or offering more information.
   - Example: ""Is there anything else I can assist you with?""

4. **Acknowledge**: Confirming understanding, agreement, or readiness to proceed.
   - Example: ""Okay, thanks for checking."" or ""Perfect, I’ll try that now.""

5. **Express Gratitude**: Showing appreciation or thanks for assistance or information.
   - Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

6. **Provide Refund Timeline**: Informing about the duration for processing a refund.
   - Example: ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days.""

7. **Request Order Number**: Asking the customer to provide their order number.
   - Example: ""Can you share the order number with me?""

8. **Confirm Issue**: Verifying or clarifying the problem or concern presented.
   - Example: ""So, the item was damaged on arrival?""

9. **Give Tip**: Offering helpful suggestions without detailed steps.
   - Example: ""It might help to restart your device.""

### Labeling Guidelines:

- Ensure consistency in labeling similar phrases. For instance, ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be labeled as ""close_conversation.""
- Use context to determine intent. Acknowledge phrases can signal readiness to proceed or confirm understanding.
- Avoid false splits by referring to these examples and definitions to distinguish between intents.
- Maintain separate intents for messages that convey different actions or requests, even if they appear in quick succession.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement:

- Continuously refine intent definitions and examples by reviewing ambiguous cases.
- Encourage ongoing review and refinement based on new data or ambiguous cases.
- Implement a feedback mechanism for users to flag difficult-to-classify messages for further analysis and definition adjustment.",6.0,,,0.4699180112633404,0.5492063492063491,0.3855421686746987,0.2580819553922472,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

23,feedback_1,"Categorize the given customer service responses into distinct and clearly defined intent labels, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Follow these refined guidelines and examples to assist in this process:

1. **Intent Categories:**
   - Provide clear definitions to differentiate similar intents:
     - **Acknowledge:** Recognizing receipt of information without explicit gratitude. Example: ""Okay, let me check.""
     - **Express_Gratitude:** Explicit thanks or appreciation. Example: ""That’s helpful, thanks!""

2. **Common Intent Examples:**
   - **Confirm_Solution:** Indicating a solution has been accepted. Example: ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!""
   - **Close_Conversation:** Finalizing the interaction. Examples: ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

3. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Strengthen differentiation cues for intents like ""Acknowledge"" versus ""Express_Gratitude"". Explicit gratitude terms such as ""thanks"" or ""appreciate"" should be categorized as ""Express_Gratitude"".

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Maintain uniformity in labeling similar responses. For instance, both ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should be labeled as ""Close_Conversation"".

5. **Handling Multiple Actions:**
   - Provide clear instructions for messages with multiple intents. Decide whether to split into separate intents or choose a primary one, e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" could be split into ""Acknowledge"" and ""Express_Gratitude"".

6. **Refined Definitions for Edge Cases:**
   - Clearly distinguish between overlapping intents like ""Offer_Additional_Help"" and ""Close_Conversation"". For example, ""Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should be categorized as ""Offer_Additional_Help"".

7. **Handling Ambiguous Phrases:**
   - Use context to interpret ambiguous phrases, ensuring specificity. For instance, differentiate ""offer_alternative_updates"" from ""explain_issue"" by context in messages like ""I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives.""

8. **Regular Review and Adjustment:**
   - Emphasize the importance of regularly updating intent categories to reflect changes in customer interaction patterns, minimizing errors like ""false_merge"" and ""false_split"".

9. **Illustrate with Error Examples:**
   - Use specific examples to illustrate common mistakes and corrections. For instance, separate ""Great, how long will the refund take?"" from ""ask_order_number"" to clarify distinct intents.

By implementing these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and consistency of intent categorization in customer service interactions.",7.0,,,0.3406907170441308,0.6316205533596838,0.2972972972972973,0.2151872592239213,"[19. 23. 16.  5. 14.  3. 17. 10. 12.  8.  4. 22.  2. 16.  9. 18.  0. 13.

0,warm_start,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiating between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some refined guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:**
   - Example: Differentiate ""assistant: Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed."" (intent: confirm_issue) from ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" (intent: acknowledge).

2. **Avoid False Merges:**
   - Example: Distinguish ""customer: That’s helpful, thanks!"" (intent: express_gratitude) from ""customer: Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" (intent: confirm_solution).

3. **Standardize Instructional Language:**
   - Example: Separate ""assistant: If you don’t see the email, please check your spam folder."" (intent: give_tip) from ""assistant: I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives."" (intent: offer_alternative_updates).

4. **Consistent Recognition of Similar Intents:**
   - Example: Ensure consistency in labeling ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" as (intent: close_conversation).

5. **Refine Request Differentiation:**
   - Example: Use consistent labeling for ""assistant: I’m really sorry about that! Can you share the order number with me?"" and ""assistant: Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" as (intent: request_order_number).

6. **Disambiguate Similar Yet Distinct Intents:**
   - Example: Differentiate ""assistant: Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" (intent: offer_additional_help) from ""assistant: I’ll send you updates by SMS until it arrives."" (intent: offer_alternative_updates).

7. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Example: Understand context to differentiate ""offer_additional_help"" from ""give_tip,"" ensuring accurate capture of message purposes.

8. **Reinforce Intent Consistency:**
   - Example: Maintain consistent labeling for intents such as ""close_conversation,"" even with slight phrasings like ""assistant: You’re very welcome!"" and ""assistant: Alright, have a good day!""

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

3,warm_start,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs.

2. **Emphasize Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Ensure similar phrases are tagged with the same intent. For example, ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should both fall under ""close_conversation."" Provide additional examples like these to reinforce consistency.

3. **Provide Examples for False Splits**:
   - Highlight cases where different phrases should be categorized under the same intent. For instance, ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both express ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Encourage Use of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" likely indicates ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s all"" might signal ""end_request"" based on dialogue progression.

5. **Refine Instructions for Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess the need for detailed distinctions among intents. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

6. **Incorporate More Examples of False Merges**:
   - Demonstrate how similar messages can embody different intents due to context. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be tagged as both ""apology"" and ""order_number_request.""

7. **Highlight the Importance of Intent Grouping**:
   - Group intents by their underlying goal. Reinforce that all closing statements, regardless of wording, should fall under ""close_conversation.""

8. **Introduce Disambiguation Strategies**:
   - Utilize explicit strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation's stage or previous interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

9. **Use More Illustrative Examples**:
   - Integrate additional examples from common pitfalls to ensure correct categorization, such as distinguishing ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_forgot_password.""

By following these guidelines, you will create more accurate and coherent clusters of customer service messages, enhancing the effectiveness of the chat responses.",,,,0.5226651228327732,0.9039226080042408,0.4666666666666667,0.4724488209438572,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

4,feedback_0,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, differentiating between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are some refined guidelines and examples to help you:

1. **Enhance Recognition of Similar Phrasings for Consistent Intents:**
   - Consistently label expressions of gratitude such as ""Okay, thanks for the advice,"" ""Got it, thanks,"" and ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" as (intent: express_gratitude).

2. **Differentiate Closely Related Intents:**
   - Emphasize recognizing specific actions or agreements to differentiate intents like ""provide_payment_method"" and ""agree_to_try."" For example, distinguish ""With a credit card"" from ""I’ll try PayPal.""

3. **Clarify Intent Boundaries for Endings and Closures:**
   - Reinforce the difference between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation,"" distinguishing messages like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" from ""Great. Have a wonderful day!""

4. **Use Consistent Terminology for Similar Actions:**
   - Standardize intent labels like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" as (intent: offer_solution).

5. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Highlight the importance of context to differentiate similar intents like ""offer_additional_help"" and ""offer_alternative_updates.""

6. **Standardize Language for Common Requests:**
   - Use consistent intent labeling for requests such as ""request_order_number"" by recognizing similar phrasing.

7. **Reinforce Consistency in Closing Statements:**
   - Ensure that intents like ""close_conversation"" are consistently applied to varied phrasings like ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

8. **Disambiguate Errors and Solutions:**
   - Clarify the separation between describing an error and agreeing to a solution, as seen in messages like ""Yes, it said 'transaction declined'"" and ""I’ll try PayPal.""

By focusing on these areas, the intent discovery process can produce more accurate and meaningful clusters, reducing instances of both false splits and merges.",0.0,,,0.4251179299910477,0.6839569160997733,0.448,0.2907623483753963,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

5,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Stress the importance of distinguishing between expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" and standalone gratitude expressions like ""Thank you for helping me,"" unless part of a closing dialogue.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide examples to differentiate similar intents like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be primarily labeled as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Emphasize consistency when clustering acknowledgments. Use context to decide if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" should be grouped together or separately, depending on the specific action each acknowledgment implies.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Illustrate when multiple intents are present in a single message. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" should encompass both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance.""

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Encourage using the surrounding conversation context to accurately determine intents. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number"" based on the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

By adhering to these guidelines, ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing the likelihood of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.5866176001462057,0.9064625850340136,0.6375,0.5317469062549789,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

6,feedback_0,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content. 

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly distinguish intents such as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude."" Use ""close_conversation"" for messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" which aim to conclude an interaction.

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Provide distinct categories for similar intents. For instance, separate ""ask_order_number"" (e.g., ""Can you give me your order number?"") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"") as they seek different information.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Ensure all expressions of thanks are consistently categorized under ""express_gratitude,"" such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Got it, thanks.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use context to differentiate similar intents like ""provide_new_address"" (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."") from ""provide_guidance"" (e.g., ""If the card still fails later, contact your bank for details."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Specify when to split or merge intents based on differences, such as separating ""confirm_action"" (e.g., ""I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent."") from ""confirm_overcharge"" (e.g., ""You were indeed charged twice for delivery."").

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents like ""report_payment_failure"" (e.g., ""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (e.g., ""Did you receive any error message?"").

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing ""accept_solution"" (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders."").

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents, such as differentiating ""describe_issue"" (e.g., ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (e.g., ""Please for all future orders.""). 

By following these guidelines, enhance the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.4532005658934174,0.8261070526695526,0.4508196721311475,0.3743921837583844,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

7,feedback_0,"### Improved Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",3.0,,,0.7327216376763207,0.9560090702947844,0.7560975609756097,0.7004885316198113,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

8,feedback_1,"In the conversation between a customer and an assistant, accurately identify the intent or action associated with each statement or query. Focus on recognizing when different phrasings convey similar intents, clearly distinguishing between closely related intents, and using consistent terminology for intent labeling. Here are refined guidelines and examples to assist you:

1. **Consistent Recognition for Acknowledgment:**
   - Ensure that acknowledgment expressions like ""Perfect, I’ll try that now,"" ""Okay, let me check,"" and ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are consistently labeled as (intent: acknowledge).

2. **Differentiate Information Requests and Solution Offers:**
   - Clearly differentiate intents such as ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" from ""offer_solution."" For example, distinguish ""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"" from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

3. **Refine Problem Reporting vs. Update Requests:**
   - Precisely differentiate intents like ""report_billing_issue"" from ""request_update_address."" For instance, distinguish ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" from ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address.""

4. **Standardize Intent Labeling for Similar Actions:**
   - Recognize similar phrasing for actions like ""offer_solution,"" such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account.""

5. **Clarify Boundaries for Similar Requests:**
   - Reinforce differentiation between similar intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"" with clear examples, such as ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order"" versus ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

6. **Disambiguate Confirming Actions vs. Reassuring Customers:**
   - Highlight the difference between ""confirm_action"" and ""reassure_customer."" For example, differentiate ""Perfect, I’ll arrange for a new card to be sent to your address"" from ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot.""

7. **Standardize Language for Gratitude and Closures:**
   - Consistently apply intent labels like ""close_conversation"" to varied phrasings such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!""

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding for Similar Intents:**
   - Emphasize context to distinguish similar intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""explain_issue."" For instance, contrast ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" with ""Thank you. I see the order is on its way, but the tracking system is delayed.""

9,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent.

- **Emphasize Contextual Understanding:** Evaluate the role of each message in the conversation to correctly identify its intent. For example, in a billing issue context, ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account"" should be understood as ""offer_solution.""

- **Refine Instructions for Distinguishing Closing Statements:** Differentiate between expressions that close a conversation and those that offer gratitude. For instance, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" should be categorized as ""close_conversation,"" while ""No, that’s everything"" should be recognized as ""end_request.""

- **Improve Differentiation of Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples to distinguish similar intents, such as ""provide_refund_timeline"" versus general refund information. Statements like ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should fall under ""provide_refund_timeline.""

- **Incorporate Examples for Disambiguating Instructions and Solutions:** Use examples like ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" for ""offer_solution"" and ""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen"" for ""provide_instructions.""

- **Highlight the Need for Consistent Acknowledgment Clustering:** Use context to decide whether acknowledgment phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" should be combined into a single intent or kept separate.

- **Address Multi-Intent Messages Clearly:** Illustrate how to handle messages with multiple intents. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" should be recognized as ""offer_solution"" and potentially involve other intents depending on the broader query.

- **Provide Clear Guidelines for Intent Variability:** Recognize when multiple intents exist within a single message and classify them accurately without false merges.

- **Include Examples of Gratitude as a Distinct Intent:** Demonstrate situations where gratitude should be a standalone intent, such as ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" to prevent incorrect merges with other intents.

By implementing these guidelines, ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, reducing the likelihood of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.2833505640445911,0.8491842624495686,0.2005277044854881,0.2406168397428753,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

10,feedback_1,"Classify each statement into a relevant category label based on its intent or content.

### Guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - Clearly define each intent with examples. Use ""close_conversation"" for statements intended to end an interaction, such as ""Have a great day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Differentiate from ""express_gratitude,"" which includes expressions like ""Thank you for the help.""

2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents:**
   - Create distinct categories for intents that are contextually different. For example, ""request_order_number"" involves asking for an order number, such as ""Can you share the order number with me?"" while ""ask_order_number"" might be used in different contexts.

3. **Encourage Consistency in Grouping:**
   - Group similar expressions under the same intent consistently. For instance, all expressions of gratitude, including ""Perfect, thank you for the help,"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude.""

4. **Highlight Contextual Cues:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate between similar intents. For example, distinguish ""provide_instructions"" (""You can reset it by tapping 'Forgot password' on the login screen."") from ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by the nature of the message.

5. **Refine Instructions for Specificity:**
   - Provide clear criteria for when to split or merge intents. For instance, differentiate ""confirm_solution"" (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"") from ""express_gratitude"" based on the action or confirmation involved.

6. **Provide Examples with Clear Boundaries:**
   - Include examples to clearly delineate intents. For instance, distinguish ""report_payment_failure"" (""My payment failed when I tried to check out."") from ""ask_error_details"" (""Did you receive any error message?"") with context on the inquiry.

7. **Improve Categorization for Multi-Part Interactions:**
   - Address multi-part interactions by distinguishing intents like ""accept_solution"" (""Yes please, that would be great."") from ""request_permanent_change"" (""Please for all future orders."") to ensure clarity.

8. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Train the model to understand the conversation flow to accurately assign intents. For example, differentiate ""describe_issue"" (""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."") from ""request_permanent_change"" by analyzing the surrounding context.

By following these guidelines, improve the accuracy and structure of intent classification, ensuring a refined understanding and categorization of conversation statements.",2.0,,,0.3875018203734508,0.7008092715723595,0.3928571428571429,0.2715648684688814,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

11,feedback_1,"### Refined Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This involves tagging each response with a specific intent label to effectively guide the conversation. Follow these enhanced instructions for precise intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Define each intent clearly and provide examples to prevent confusion. For instance, differentiate between ""confirm_update"" and ""confirm_overcharge"" with examples such as ""Done, your profile has been updated"" for ""confirm_update"" and ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" for ""confirm_overcharge.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For example, consistently tag ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as ""close_conversation"" to avoid splitting into ""end_request"" or ""close_conversation"" based on minor wording variations.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how context can alter a message's intent. For instance, differentiate ""I’ll try PayPal"" as ""agree_to_try"" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now"" as ""acknowledge,"" using context to guide intent recognition.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid unnecessary granularity unless it aligns with business objectives. For example, decide when to split intents like ""provide_instructions"" and ""provide_guidance"" based on their business significance.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Offer detailed examples of false merges to clarify intent distinctions. For instance, distinguish ""Hello, I want to update my delivery address"" as ""request_update_address"" from ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield"" as ""provide_new_address.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Group intents based on broader goals. Ensure all phrases aiming to close a conversation are tagged under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of wording differences.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Suggest strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as using previous interactions to differentiate intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation."" Clarify when ""No, that’s everything"" should be an ""end_request"" versus ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include diverse examples, particularly from error cases, to guide correct categorization. Differentiate intents like ""offer_solution"" and ""suggest_troubleshooting"" by considering scenarios where context determines the intent, such as offering a refund versus suggesting a fix.

By applying these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy and consistency of intent identification in customer service interactions, enhancing the overall customer experience.",3.0,,,0.4928677186328189,0.9332563213964832,0.4065040650406503,0.4599719140263414,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Combine similar intents to avoid unnecessary complexity. For example, merge ""request_order_number"" and ""ask_order_number"" into a single ""order_number_request"" intent unless distinct purposes are required by business needs. Reinforce this with examples like ""assistant: Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""assistant: Glad I could help!"" both falling under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Tag similar phrases consistently. For instance, ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should both be tagged as ""close_conversation"" to prevent false splits. Provide additional examples to reinforce this consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Use conversation context to differentiate between intents. For example, ""customer: Okay, thanks for checking."" could mean ""acknowledge"" or ""express_gratitude"" depending on previous dialogue. Highlight how context determines intent, as seen in examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" for ""close_conversation"" versus ""No, that’s all"" for ""end_request.""

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Assess when detailed distinctions between intents are necessary. Avoid overly granular differences like ""provide_refund_timeline"" vs. ""provide_instructions"" unless they serve distinct business objectives.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Provide examples to demonstrate how similar messages can have different intents due to context. For example, ""customer: Hi, I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be distinctly tagged as ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure.""

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Reinforce the grouping of intents based on their goals. Highlight that all closure-related phrases should consistently be tagged as ""close_conversation,"" regardless of their wording.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Provide strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as assessing the stage of the conversation or prior interactions, to differentiate between intents like ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Add additional examples, especially from common pitfalls, to ensure correct categorization. Differentiate between intents like ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" with illustrative scenarios.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",,,,0.6402509353401891,0.922481612966042,0.6461538461538462,0.5906197155356346,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

1,warm_start,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize the importance of context when grouping expressions that indicate closing a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" Distinguish these from expressions of gratitude like ""Thank you for helping me,"" which should stand alone unless they are part of a closing sequence.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide clear examples that differentiate between similar intents, such as gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be categorized as both ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude,"" while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should primarily be seen as ""express_gratitude.""

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Ensure consistency when grouping acknowledgments. Context should guide whether phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" are grouped together or separately. The specific action associated with each acknowledgment should be the deciding factor.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Recognize and illustrate when multiple intents exist within a single message. For example, a message like ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" encompasses both ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance,"" and should be categorized accordingly.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Use the surrounding conversation context to determine intents accurately. For example, both ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" should be classified under ""provide_order_number,"" guided by the preceding request for this information.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to prevent false merges. Use examples like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" and ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" to demonstrate when gratitude should be treated as a distinct intent.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",,,,0.3989429219702807,0.7985149308618041,0.4351145038167939,0.3185618797549048,"[73.  7. 32. 84. 21. 33. 48.  2. 20. 39. 19. 69.  8. 31. 84. 40. 44.  1.

2,feedback_0,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on merging intents that serve similar functions. For example, combine ""acknowledge_and_thank"" with ""express_gratitude"" unless there are explicit reasons to keep them separate. Use examples such as ""customer: Okay, I’ll do that now. Thanks for your support!"" and ""customer: Perfect, thank you for the help."" to illustrate this consolidation.

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases to avoid false splits. For instance, ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be tagged as ""accept_solution."" Use these phrases to demonstrate the importance of consistency.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Highlight how conversation context can alter intent interpretation. For example, ""Okay, let me check."" can imply ""acknowledge"" or ""accept_solution"" depending on preceding messages. Use examples like ""customer: That would be good."" and ""customer: Oh, I didn’t realize."" to show context's impact on intent.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions unless necessary for business objectives. Illustrate this by addressing errors such as tagging ""provide_refund_timeline"" and ""provide_instructions"" separately without clear differentiation.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to show how context alters intent, preventing false merges. For instance, differentiate ""customer: Awesome, appreciate the help!"" from ""customer: Perfect, thank you."" as ""express_gratitude"" and ""accept_solution"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their overarching goal. For example, all phrases related to closing should fall under ""close_conversation,"" regardless of specific wording. Use examples like ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" to emphasize this point.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as analyzing the conversation stage or prior interactions. For example, differentiate between ""end_request"" and ""close_conversation"" based on whether further action is implied.

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a wider range of examples to cover common pitfalls. For instance, differentiate ""report_billing_issue"" from ""report_overcharge"" with scenarios like ""customer: I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" vs. ""customer: Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out.""

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.3180827175924228,0.7218621463737009,0.2480286738351254,0.229611873245646,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they appear in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""close_conversation"".

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Okay, let me check."" fall under ""acknowledge"" or if they indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s 67221."" as ""provide_order_number"" if they respond to a request for an order number.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they serve a dual purpose.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.3768676215114094,0.681635416368167,0.4010791366906475,0.2568863181046104,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"### Enhanced Intent Discovery Prompt

In this exercise, your task is to generate responses for a customer service chat by identifying the underlying intent of each customer's message. This requires tagging each response with a specific intent label to guide the conversation effectively. Follow these refined instructions to ensure accurate intent identification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions and Consolidation**:
   - Provide clear guidelines on when to merge intents and when to keep them distinct. Combine intents that express similar functions, such as gratitude or closure, unless the context significantly changes their meaning. For example, merge ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help!"" under ""close_conversation"".

2. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrases**:
   - Reinforce consistent tagging across similar phrases by using specific examples. For instance, ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" and ""Got it, thanks."" should both be tagged as ""express_gratitude"". Highlight these to stress the importance of uniformity in tagging similar expressions.

3. **Emphasize the Role of Context**:
   - Clearly illustrate how context can change intent interpretation. For example, ""Yes, it’s 58291."" could mean ""provide_order_number"" if followed by order-related queries. Use such examples to show how preceding messages can shift intent, preventing errors like false merges.

4. **Clarify Intent Granularity**:
   - Avoid overly granular distinctions that do not serve a clear business purpose. For example, differentiate between ""provide_item_details"" and ""describe_error_message"" only when necessary. Ensure clarity in examples like ""Yes, it says my password is incorrect."" versus ""A carton of milk."" to prevent incorrect merges.

5. **Illustrate False Merges Thoroughly**:
   - Use examples to illustrate how seemingly similar intents may require separation. For example, do not merge ""Yes, it’s 58291."" and ""It’s FREEDELIVERY."" as they represent ""provide_order_number"" and ""provide_voucher_code"" respectively.

6. **Group Intents by Underlying Goal**:
   - Focus on grouping intents by their ultimate goal, such as merging all closing phrases under ""close_conversation"". This prevents false splits seen in examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""You’re very welcome!"", which should be unified under a single intent.

7. **Introduce Robust Disambiguation Techniques**:
   - Offer practical strategies for resolving ambiguities, such as considering the conversation stage or examining previous interactions. For example, differentiate intents like ""confirm_refund"" and ""provide_payment_method"" based on context, seen in ""Refund has been processed."" versus ""With a credit card.""

8. **Integrate More Varied Examples**:
   - Include a broader range of examples that capture common pitfalls. Differentiate between ""report_billing_issue"" and ""report_overcharge"" using scenarios such as ""I think I was overcharged on my last bill."" to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential errors.

By incorporating these guidelines, you will enhance the accuracy and coherence of message clustering, thereby improving the quality of customer service interactions.",0.0,,,0.6268253842488088,0.9031630258115054,0.6115288220551379,0.5661255106936137,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Please read the following responses and categorize them into a list of distinct actions or intents. Consider the context and role of each message in the conversation to accurately determine the intent. 

- **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Distinguish between expressions used to close a conversation, such as ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Glad I could help!"", and expressions of gratitude, like ""Thank you for helping me"". Categorize them as ""close_conversation"" and ""express_gratitude"" respectively, unless they follow a gratitude expression in a closing sequence. For example, ""Perfect, thank you for the help"" should be ""express_gratitude"" unless used to conclude the exchange.

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Provide specific examples to differentiate between similar intents, like gratitude and confirmation. For instance, ""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"" should be split into ""confirm_solution"" and ""express_gratitude"", while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be categorized as ""express_gratitude"".

- **Encourage Intent Consistency:** Use context to consistently categorize acknowledgments. Determine if phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking."" are acknowledgments or indicate another action, ensuring consistency based on their context and surrounding conversation.

- **Highlight Intent Variability:** Identify multiple intents within a single message, such as ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"", which includes ""offer_help"" and ""inquire_further_assistance"". Categorize each intent to avoid oversimplification.

- **Provide More Contextual Cues:** Leverage surrounding conversation context for accurate intent classification. For example, classify ""Yes, it’s 58291."" as ""provide_order_number"" only if it responds to a request for an order number. Ensure that context is considered in scenarios where intent might be ambiguous.

- **Standardize Expression of Gratitude:** Clearly separate gratitude from other intents to avoid false merges. Treat expressions of gratitude, like ""That’s helpful, thanks!"", as distinct intents unless they are part of a dual-purpose exchange.

Apply these guidelines to ensure accurate and coherent classification of intents, minimizing instances of false splits and merges.",1.0,,,0.4376941079486332,0.7372108438517107,0.4864341085271318,0.3226728426697336,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_0,"Categorize each interaction between a customer and an assistant by examining both the wording and the context to determine the true intent or purpose of the message. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Recognize when messages should be grouped under a single intent versus when they should be split. Variations in phrasing do not indicate different intents if the underlying purpose is the same. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""You’re very welcome!"" both serve the intent of ""close_conversation"".

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Focus on the specific issue or action being described, rather than general similarities. Identify unique aspects of the message content that signal different intents, such as distinguishing between ""report_overcharge"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Identify common phrases that share the same intent despite appearing different. For example, ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" and ""Got it, thanks."" both express ""express_gratitude"".

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual cues to identify the broader intent, such as offering further assistance or closing the conversation. Messages like ""Happy to help! Anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" both offer ""offer_additional_help"".

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Recognize that complex interactions may involve multiple distinct intents. Break down messages to discern different stages or aspects of the conversation, such as distinguishing ""report_problem"" from ""confirm_attempted_solution"".

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Look for specific problem descriptions that differentiate intents, even when they seem related. For example, ""The card isn't being recognized at checkout."" and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" should be separate as ""describe_issue"" and ""report_payment_failure"".

By following these guidelines, you can accurately categorize each interaction to improve the clustering accuracy of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3309779514644528,0.7885051456480029,0.3107569721115538,0.260977817825756,"[42.  3. 20. 49. 13. 21. 28.  0. 12. 24. 11. 37. 45. 33. 14. 28.  9. 35.

5,feedback_0,"Classify the given text into one of the predefined categories based on its intended outcome. 

**Guidelines:**
1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Use contextual cues to differentiate similar intents. For example, phrases like ""You're welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" should be grouped under ""close_conversation,"" whereas ""Thank you"" belongs to ""express_gratitude.""
   
2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Focus on the distinct action or response expected. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" should be categorized as ""confirm_update,"" while ""Thanks. I checked and you were indeed charged twice for delivery"" falls under ""confirm_overcharge.""

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Look for keywords indicating a question (e.g., ""Could you,"" ""Can you"") versus a statement (e.g., ""You can,"" ""It is possible"") to differentiate intents like ""ask_new_address"" and ""provide_guidance.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Recognize that different phrasings can map to the same intent. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" both belong to ""close_conversation.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Consider the context and the action or reassurance being communicated. For example, ""Yes, you’ll receive an email"" should be ""confirm_process,"" while ""If you don’t see the email"" should be ""give_tip.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Identify the primary action or request. For example, ""Got it. Do you want to apply this change"" is a request for confirmation, while ""Hi, I can’t track my order"" indicates a request for assistance.

6,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

7,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts. Ensure accurate clustering by considering the following:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Group similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" with examples like ""You too! Take care."" and ""Alright, have a good day!""

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Differentiate between similar intents by recognizing nuances, such as ""confirm_issue"" (e.g., ""Thanks for that. I see two payments for the same order indeed."") versus ""acknowledge"" (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."").

3. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:** Consider the context in which a message is sent. For example, distinguish between requesting information (""Can you share the order number with me?"") and confirming a solution (""Yes, that worked. Thanks!"").

4. **Standardize Intent Definitions:** Use consistent definitions for each intent, such as ""express_gratitude,"" with examples like ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Perfect, thank you for the help.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Phrasing:** Recognize solution-related intents despite varied phrasing, such as ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues:** Distinguish between similar closing phrases using context and speaker roles, such as ""Have a great day."" (closing conversation) versus ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" (ending a request).

8,feedback_1,"Determine the true intent or purpose of each interaction between a customer and an assistant by analyzing both the wording and context. 

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries**: Group messages with the same underlying purpose, regardless of phrasing differences. For example, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" share the ""close_conversation"" intent. Focus on the core purpose behind the wording.

2. **Differentiate Similar Actions**: Examine the specific content and action described to identify distinct intents, even for similar messages. Differentiate between intents like ""ask_clarification"" and ""request_bill_id"" by determining if the goal is to clarify a general issue or request specific information.

3. **Address Common Ambiguities**: Recognize phrases that, despite different wording, share the same intent. For instance, ""Okay, let me check."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both indicate ""acknowledge"" and should be grouped under this intent.

4. **Include Contextual Cues**: Use contextual clues to understand broader intents, such as concluding an interaction or offering further help. For example, ""Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Take care!"" both indicate a ""close_conversation"" intent.

5. **Highlight Intent Complexity**: Break down complex interactions into multiple intents. For example, ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"" should be separated into ""apologize"" and ""ask_order_number"" to reflect different conversation stages.

6. **Encourage Specificity in Intent Identification**: Focus on specific details that separate intents, even if they seem related. Distinguish between ""confirm_update"" and ""provide_order_number"" by identifying the specific action or information being confirmed or provided.

**Guidelines:**

1. **Clarifying Similar Intent Categories:**
   - Differentiate between intents with distinct purposes using contextual cues. For example, ""Would you like me to request a replacement card for you?"" and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded to your account."" should be categorized under ""offer_solution"" as they both involve problem-solving actions.

2. **Avoiding False Merges:**
   - Identify unique actions to prevent incorrect merging of intents. For instance, ""Done, your profile has been updated"" is ""confirm_update,"" while ""I’ll try PayPal"" involves ""agree_to_try,"" reflecting different intents.

3. **Enhancing Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Use specific keywords or phrases to distinguish inquiries from guidance. For example, ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" is ""reassure_customer,"" while ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" is ""provide_instructions.""

4. **Variety of Examples:**
   - Group expressions with similar sentiments under the same intent. For instance, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should be categorized as ""offer_additional_help.""

5. **Encouraging Contextual Understanding:**
   - Recognize the context and intent behind each message. For example, ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days"" should be ""provide_refund_timeline,"" while ""Your delivery should still arrive within the scheduled slot"" should be ""reassure_customer.""

6. **Refining Action-Based Instructions:**
   - Focus on the primary action or request in the message. For example, ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card"" is a ""report_problem,"" and ""Hi, I can’t track my order in the app"" is a ""report_tracking_issue.""

10,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction by analyzing the context and action taken.

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group expressions conveying similar sentiments under a unified intent. For example, map ""Glad I could help!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide guidance to distinguish between actions with different intents. For example, use `ask_new_address` for ""Could you provide me with the new address?"" and `ask_payment_method` for ""Was this with a credit card or PayPal?"".

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Promote precise intent identification even when messages seem similar. Classify ""Okay, let me check."" as `acknowledge` and ""Okay, thanks for the quick check."" as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. Classify ""Perfect, thank you for the help."" as `express_gratitude`, while ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be labeled as `acknowledge`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for dealing with messages containing multiple intents, ensuring each intent is identified. For instance, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure messages with similar outcomes are consistently labeled. For example, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual information to disambiguate similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify intent definitions to avoid overlaps and ensure distinct categorization. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation`, while ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be `end_request`.

9. **Reinforce the Importance of Contextual Understanding:** Emphasize understanding the conversation context to accurately assign intents. For instance, distinguish between ""Hi, I was charged twice for the same order."" as `report_billing_issue` and ""Hi, my payment failed when I tried to check out."" as `report_payment_failure`.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Emphasize grouping similar expressions under a single intent, such as ""close_conversation,"" to avoid false splits. For example, phrases like ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" and ""You too! Take care."" should consistently be categorized together.

2. **Distinguish Subtle Differences:** Highlight specific language cues to differentiate between similar intents. For instance, distinguish ""ask_clarification"" (""Can you tell me what exactly is going wrong?"") from ""request_order_number"" (""Can you share the order number with me?"").

1,warm_start,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken. 

1. **Clarify Common Phrases for Similar Intents:** Group variations of similar phrases under a unified intent. For example, map messages like ""You’re welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" to `close_conversation`.

2. **Differentiate Between Similar Actions:** Provide separate intents for messages with distinct actions. For instance, use `confirm_update` for ""Done, your profile has been updated."" and `describe_error_message` for ""Yes, it said “transaction declined.”

3. **Encourage Specific Intent Identification:** Identify specific intents even when actions seem similar. For example, classify ""Yes please, that would be great."" as `accept_solution` and ""Yes, it’s 99420."" as `provide_bill_id`.

4. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Actions:** Recognize distinct intents from subtle phrasing differences. For example, ""Okay, thanks for checking."" should be `acknowledge` while ""Okay, thanks for the advice."" should be `express_gratitude`.

5. **Provide Instructions on Handling Mixed Intents:** Offer strategies for messages with multiple intents, ensuring each is identified. For example, classify ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request` and ""Happy to help! Have a nice day."" as `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Consistent Labeling for Similar Outcomes:** Ensure consistent labeling for messages describing similar processes. For instance, both ""Refunds are usually processed within 3–5 business days."" and ""Refunds usually show within 2–3 business days."" should map to `provide_refund_timeline`.

7. **Provide More Contextual Disambiguation Cues:** Use contextual cues to disambiguate functionally similar intents. For example, ""Of course! Happy to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today?"" and ""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"" should both map to `offer_additional_help`.

8. **Address Potential Overlaps in Intent Definitions:** Clarify and re-evaluate intents to avoid overlaps. For example, classify ""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."" as `close_conversation` and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" as `end_request`.

By following these guidelines, ensure accurate and consistent classification of customer support messages based on their true intents.",,,,0.5220225073971582,0.8842336482615645,0.5127582017010935,0.4615898661904387,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

2,feedback_0,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Use clear examples to illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent to avoid false splits. For instance, ensure phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" are consistently categorized under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Highlight Subtle Differences in Similar Intents:** Provide detailed examples to distinguish closely related intents. Differentiate between ""ask_voucher_code"" and ""ask_order_number"" with specific language cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Reinforce the importance of understanding the conversation context to correctly identify intents. Recognize intents like ""diagnose_issue"" versus ""offer_compensation"" by understanding the broader service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear and consistent examples for each intent to prevent confusion. Ensure phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" are always classified as ""acknowledge.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Offer guidance on identifying solution-related intents, ensuring different phrasings are recognized under the same intent. For example, both ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""I’ll manually add the points to your account now"" should be categorized under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of context and speaker roles to distinguish similar closing phrases and intents. Differentiate between ""close_conversation"" and ""end_request"" by examining the speaker and context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for more granular categorization, especially in broader intent categories. Provide examples of sub-intents, such as distinguishing ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages.",0.0,,,0.3627834722431216,0.7128959682418796,0.3486943164362518,0.2586268747069112,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

3,feedback_0,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly differentiate between intents with similar functions. For example, distinguish between `ask_error_details` (""Sorry to hear that! Are you getting an error message?"") and `request_receipt_number` (""Can you share your receipt number?"").

2. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle differences in context or phrasing to accurately classify intents. For example, differentiate between `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") and `acknowledge` (""Got it, thanks."").

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Use consistent labels for messages leading to the same outcome. For instance, both ""Glad I could help!"" and ""You’re very welcome"" should be classified as `close_conversation`.

4. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents in a single message. For example, ""You’re welcome. I’ll keep tracking your order until it’s delivered,"" should include both `express_gratitude` and `confirm_followup`.

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to avoid false splits. For example, ""Great. Have a wonderful day!"" and ""Glad I could help!"" should map to `close_conversation`.

6. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. For instance, distinguish ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`) from ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`).

7. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate intents that might seem similar. For example, separate `ask_new_address` from `report_voucher_issue` to avoid misclassification.

8. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Clarify and redefine overlapping intents to improve accuracy. For example, separate `end_request` (""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"") from `close_conversation` (""You’re very welcome! Have a great day."").

4,feedback_1,"Identify distinct customer service intents within conversation excerpts by considering the following guidelines to ensure accurate clustering:

1. **Emphasize Consistent Grouping for Similar Expressions:** Illustrate the need for grouping similar expressions under a single intent with examples. For instance, categorize phrases like ""Alright, have a good day!"" and ""Happy to help!"" consistently under ""close_conversation.""

2. **Clarify Intent Distinctions with Examples:** Use specific examples to highlight subtle differences between closely related intents. Differentiate ""ask_voucher_code"" from ""ask_order_number"" with cues such as ""What voucher code are you trying to use?"" versus ""Can you give me your order number?""

3. **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Stress the importance of understanding the broader conversation context to accurately identify intents. For example, distinguish ""diagnose_issue"" from ""offer_compensation"" by recognizing the specific service context.

4. **Standardize and Clarify Intent Definitions:** Provide clear examples to ensure consistent intent classification. Phrases like ""Okay, thanks for checking"" should always be classified under ""acknowledge,"" while ""Perfect, thank you"" should be under ""express_gratitude.""

5. **Address Ambiguity in Solution-Related Intents:** Guide the recognition of solution-related intents by categorizing different phrasings under the same intent. For instance, ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" and ""Understood. You can change it in Settings → Language → English"" should fall under ""offer_solution.""

6. **Use Disambiguation Cues for Closing Phrases:** Encourage the use of speaker roles and context to distinguish similar closing phrases. Differentiate ""close_conversation"" from ""end_request"" by identifying whether the speaker is the customer or assistant and examining the conversation context.

7. **Promote Intent Specificity with Granular Categorization:** Highlight the need for granular categorization within broader intents. Distinguish ""express_gratitude"" from ""acknowledge_and_thank"" by recognizing when gratitude is expressed standalone versus when it accompanies acknowledgment of a solution.

8. **Encourage Use of Speaker Context:** Stress the importance of identifying the speaker (customer or assistant) to accurately classify intents, particularly in mixed dialogues. This helps avoid errors like merging intents that belong to different roles, such as ""describe_issue"" and ""confirm_overcharge.""

By applying these guidelines, achieve more accurate and nuanced clustering of customer service messages for improved intent discovery and reduced errors.",0.0,,,0.3392932480499438,0.6273454689869914,0.2936630602782071,0.2128540818220116,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"Assign a classification label to each customer support interaction based on the context or action taken.

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Clearly define and differentiate between intents with similar functions. For instance, distinguish between `acknowledge` (""Okay, let me check."") and `express_gratitude` (""Appreciate the help!"") to avoid confusion and ensure precise clustering.

2. **Address Compound Intent Handling:** Identify and label multiple intents within a single message. For example, in ""No worries, resetting usually solves this problem. Would you like me to guide you through it?"", recognize both `offer_solution` and `offer_assistance`.

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Labels:** Ensure that similar messages consistently lead to the same intent label. For example, both ""Appreciate the help!"" and ""Got it, thanks."" should be labeled as `express_gratitude`.

4. **Include Instructions for Contextual Nuances:** Capture subtle contextual differences to enhance precision in intent classification. Distinguish between `report_problem` (""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."") and `report_login_issue` (""Hi, I can’t log in to the app anymore."").

5. **Refine Instructions for Similar Phrases:** Group similar phrases under the same intent to prevent false splits. Ensure that ""Much appreciated!"" and ""Thanks, that works."" are categorized under `express_gratitude`.

6. **Suggest Contextual Clarity for Intent Differentiation:** Use contextual cues to differentiate overlapping intents. For instance, clearly separate `request_update_address` from `report_forgot_password` to avoid misclassification.

7. **Re-evaluate and Define Intent Categories Clearly:** Provide distinct definitions for overlapping intent categories to enhance classification accuracy. For example, differentiate between `provide_refund_timeline` and `explain_reason` for refund-related messages.

8. **Encourage Detailed Intent Recognition:** Recognize and label distinct intents within similar actions. Distinguish between ""I’ll refund the extra charge immediately"" (`confirm_solution`) and ""I’ll make sure one of the charges is refunded"" (`offer_solution`).

9. **Incorporate Disambiguation Cues:** Add cues or examples to help distinguish often-confused intents. Differentiate between `offer_additional_help` (""Great to hear! Anything else I can help with?"") and `offer_solution` (""Would you like me to issue you a different voucher?"") using scenario-based examples.

3,feedback_0,"When assigning a label to each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Recognize messages that share the same intent despite different expressions, while also distinguishing messages with distinct purposes. Use context and the flow of conversation to guide your labeling decisions. 

- **Identify Similar Intents**: Look for messages that express the same intent using different words (e.g., ""Okay, thanks for checking."" and ""Perfect, I’ll try that now."" both convey 'acknowledge'). Group these under the same intent.

- **Emphasize Granularity**: Analyze the specific actions or information conveyed. Differentiate messages that appear related but serve different functions (e.g., ""Open the app, tap “Forgot password”, and follow the steps."" vs. ""It was SAVE20."").

- **Differentiate Actions**: Recognize messages with distinct actions or outcomes (e.g., ""I’ve added a $10 voucher to your account."" vs. ""Done. The points are now visible in your balance."") and label them separately.

- **Use Contextual Cues**: Consider the context and conversational flow to determine the intent (e.g., ""You’re very welcome!"" and ""Alright, have a good day!"" both function as 'close_conversation').

- **Distinguish Similar Responses**: Differentiate between responses with similar wording but different intents (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" vs. ""That’s helpful, thanks!"") by considering their function.

- **Create Comprehensive Labels**: Develop labels that capture both the action and context of the message, ensuring specificity and descriptiveness (e.g., ""Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield."" needs a distinct label from ""A carton of milk."").

- **Balance Specificity and Generalization**: Find a balance in label specificity. Use broader categories when appropriate, but maintain specificity when messages have distinct intents (e.g., ""I see. What voucher code are you trying to use?"" vs. ""Sorry about that. Can you give me your order number?"").

By following these guidelines, you'll improve your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, enhancing the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.2866114621833696,0.824207215844252,0.2334455667789001,0.2362272352752052,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

4,feedback_1,"Classify each input according to the following refined list of intents, taking into account the context and the role of the speaker (customer vs. assistant). Pay special attention to distinguishing between closely related intents and understanding the nuances of each category:

1. **report_wrong_order**: Identifying issues with a received order.
2. **report_missing_receipt**: Notifying about the absence of a receipt.
3. **suggest_troubleshooting**: Offering solutions to resolve an issue.
4. **acknowledge**: Recognizing or validating a statement or concern. Note that acknowledgment may coexist with gratitude but should be identified as distinct when acknowledging an action or solution.
5. **explain_reason**: Providing explanations for a situation or decision.
6. **describe_issue**: Detailing a specific problem or concern.
7. **request_replacement**: Asking for a new item in place of a faulty one.
8. **express_gratitude**: Thanking or showing appreciation. Differentiate from accepting solutions or closing conversations when gratitude is the primary intent.
9. **provide_order_number**: Supplying a reference or order number.
10. **close_conversation**: Ending the interaction. Identify when this overlaps with gratitude or other intents and determine which is predominant.
11. **accept_solution**: Agreeing to a proposed resolution. Distinguish from mere expressions of satisfaction or gratitude.
12. **offer_compensation**: Proposing a benefit as reparation.
13. **confirm_action**: Verifying that a task has been completed. Differentiate from offering solutions or confirming follow-ups.
14. **offer_discount**: Providing a price reduction as a goodwill gesture.
15. **confirm_followup**: Assuring ongoing tracking or future actions. Differentiate from confirming immediate actions.
16. **ask_payment_method**: Inquiring about the payment type used.
17. **ask_new_timeslot**: Requesting a preferred time for scheduling.
18. **provide_guidance**: Giving instructions or advice on how to proceed. Differentiate when both suggesting alternatives and providing guidance are involved.

Consider the intent's predominant purpose, context, and speaker role, ensuring that similar intents are grouped and differentiated accurately. Use examples to guide the classification, highlight common pitfalls, and provide corrective examples to avoid errors such as false splits and merges in intent classification.",0.0,,,0.3206978324821099,0.4225476791566757,0.2803418803418804,0.1355101248258919,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.

5,feedback_1,"When labeling each message, focus on identifying the underlying intent by carefully examining both subtle differences and similarities in phrasing. Here are key guidelines to assist in accurate intent discovery:

1. **Clarify Intent Identification**:
   - Identify messages that convey the same intent despite different expressions (e.g., ""Yes please, that would be great."" and ""Perfect, thank you."" should both be labeled as 'accept_solution'). Emphasize recognizing varied phrasing for similar intents.

2. **Enhance Differentiation of Actions**:
   - Clearly distinguish between messages with different actions or outcomes (e.g., ""Hi, I'm having trouble with my loyalty card."" should be labeled 'report_problem', while ""Yes, I tried both. Still doesn't work."" should be 'confirm_attempted_solution').

3. **Highlight the Need for Granularity**:
   - Focus on specific actions or outcomes in messages (e.g., ""You’re very welcome! Let me know if you need more help after resetting."" should be 'offer_followup' and ""No, that’s all. Have a nice day!"" should be 'end_request').

4. **Encourage Contextual Analysis**:
   - Use context and conversation flow to determine intent (e.g., ""I understand, that must be frustrating. Have you tried rescanning it or adding it to the app?"" should be 'suggest_troubleshooting', and ""Thanks. That code is only valid for orders above $50."" should be 'explain_restriction').

5. **Improve Label Specificity**:
   - Create labels that encapsulate both the action and context (e.g., ""Done, your profile has been updated."" should have a distinct label from ""Got it. I’ve updated your delivery slot to 6–8 pm."" by considering the specific updates being confirmed).

6. **Balance Specificity and Generalization**:
   - Find a balance between broad and specific categories (e.g., ""Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me."" and ""Thanks, that works."" should consistently be labeled as 'express_gratitude' to avoid false splits).

7. **Distinguish Function in Similar Responses**:
   - Differentiate responses with similar wording but different functions (e.g., ""That would be great, thanks!"" should be labeled 'accept_solution', while ""That’s helpful, thanks!"" should be 'express_gratitude', based on their contextual function).

By integrating these guidelines, you'll enhance your ability to accurately and contextually label messages, improving the effectiveness of intent clustering.",1.0,,,0.3597713988131546,0.688632331720567,0.3021690351533284,0.2477502172510727,"[74.  7. 33. 85. 21. 34. 49.  2. 20. 40. 19. 70.  8. 32. 85. 41. 45.  1.
