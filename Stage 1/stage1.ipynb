      "Updated Prompt: You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message, using the following guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Intent Definitions**: Clearly defined intent labels with examples are provided. For instance, \"express_gratitude\" applies to phrases like \"Thank you for your help!\" while \"close_conversation\" fits \"You’re very welcome! Have a nice day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Disambiguate Similar Intents**: Pay attention to similar intents, such as \"ask_error_details\" and \"ask_wrong_item_details.\" Use specific cues, like references to error messages or incorrect items, to distinguish between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Encourage Consistency**: Ensure consistency in labeling functionally identical intents. For example, always label \"Awesome, thanks for the quick help!\" and \"Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me.\" as \"express_gratitude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Splitting Intents**: When a message contains multiple intents, split them accordingly. For instance, \"Perfect, thank you. AND Yes, all communications will now go to the new address.\" should be split into \"express_gratitude\" and \"provide_confirmation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Contextual Understanding**: Consider the conversational context when assigning intents. For messages like \"Please go ahead,\" determine if it should be labeled as \"confirm_action\" based on surrounding messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Disambiguation Cues**: Utilize cues or keywords to differentiate intents like \"end_request\" and \"close_conversation,\" such as \"No, that’s all.\" for ending requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Evaluate New Intents**: Carefully evaluate the need for new intents, ensuring they represent a genuinely distinct purpose or issue not covered by existing labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Examples of Correct and Incorrect Labeling**: Review examples of past errors to understand common mistakes and avoid them.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, aim to produce accurate and well-structured intent clusters in your analysis.\n",

      "- **Clarify Intent Differentiation**: Recognize subtle differences between similar intents. For example, distinguish between \"express_gratitude\" (\"Thank you!\") and \"close_conversation\" (\"You’re welcome! Have a nice day.\").\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Disambiguation Cues**: Use specific cues to differentiate intents that might be confused, such as \"end_request\" (\"No, that’s it.\") and \"close_conversation\" (\"You’re welcome! Have a nice day.\"). Look for phrases that typically signal each intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Consistency in Labeling**: Ensure consistency when labeling similar phrases. For example, consistently label both \"Perfect, thank you.\" and \"Much appreciated!\" as \"express_gratitude\".\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Address Dual-Purpose Messages**: For messages with dual purposes, prioritize the primary intent or consider splitting the message into distinct intents if necessary. For instance, \"Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me.\" should focus on the primary intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Role-Based Intent Differences**: Differentiate intents based on the speaker's role. For example, label assistant responses like \"I’ll issue a refund right away\" as \"offer_solution\", whereas a customer's acknowledgment should be distinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Examples of Correct Intent Usage**: Refer to examples of correctly identified intents for guidance. For example, use \"You’re welcome! Have a nice day.\" for \"close_conversation\" and \"Thank you. I’ll issue a refund right away\" for \"offer_solution\".\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Specificity in Instructions**: Encourage specificity in identifying intents. Distinguish between intents like \"ask_error_details\" and \"ask_wrong_item_details\" to avoid false merges.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Guidance on Creating New Intents**: Provide criteria for when to create a new intent, ensuring that genuinely new issues are correctly labeled without unnecessary splits.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Incorporate Contextual Understanding**: Consider the context to identify when an expression of gratitude also serves to close a conversation, or when an acknowledgment implies acceptance of a solution.\n",

      "\n",
      "Guidelines for Intent Labeling:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:**\n",
      "   - Determine when a message should be split into multiple intents versus merged under a common intent. Consider roles (customer vs. assistant) and conversational stages (e.g., expressing gratitude vs. closing conversation).\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: customer: Awesome, appreciate the help! AND assistant: You’re very welcome!\" should have separate intents: express_gratitude AND close_conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Differentiate Similar Intents:**\n",
      "   - Identify intents that may seem similar but pertain to different contexts or actions using context-specific cues.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: assistant: Sorry to hear that! Are you getting an error message when you try to log in? AND assistant: I’m sorry to hear that! Could you tell me which product you received instead?\" should have separate intents: ask_error_details AND ask_wrong_item_details.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Encourage Consistency in Labeling:**\n",
      "   - Use a standardized list of intent labels consistently across similar messages.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: customer: Perfect, thank you. AND customer: Much appreciated!\" should have the same intent: express_gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Handle Overlaps in Conversation Stages:**\n",
      "   - Recognize when messages overlap between stages, such as concluding a request and closing the conversation, and assign separate intents.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: customer: No, that’s all. AND assistant: You’re welcome! Have a nice day.\" should have separate intents: end_request AND close_conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Incorporate Role-Specific Intent Cues:**\n",
      "   - Consider the speaker's role (customer vs. assistant) when determining the intent. Role-specific cues may affect categorization.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: assistant: You’re very welcome! Have a great day. AND customer: No, that’s all.\" should have separate intents: close_conversation AND end_request.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Provide Clear Examples of Common Errors:**\n",
      "   - Learn from common pitfalls, such as false splits and false merges. Understand why certain messages should be grouped or separated.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Encourage Thorough Contextual Analysis:**\n",
      "   - Analyze the entire conversation context, considering preceding and following messages, to ensure accurate intent labeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can accurately identify and cluster intents, enhancing the overall quality of the analysis process.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Guidelines for Intent Labeling:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:**\n",
      "   - Determine criteria for splitting versus merging intents within a single message. Consider the context and role differentiation (customer vs. assistant) to avoid false splits and false merges.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: assistant: You’re very welcome. Anything else you’d like me to check? AND assistant: Happy to help. Anything else you’d like today?\" should have the same intent: offer_additional_help.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Differentiate Similar Intents:**\n",
      "   - Provide guidance on distinguishing between intents that appear similar but are contextually different. Highlight subtle differences in actions or outcomes using examples.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: assistant: No worries, resetting usually solves this problem. Would you like me to guide you through it? AND assistant: Happy to help. Anything else you’d like today?\" should have separate intents: offer_assistance AND offer_additional_help.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Standardize Intent Labels:**\n",
      "   - Emphasize the use of a standardized list of intent labels and ensure consistent application across similar messages to reduce false splits.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: customer: It’s 78342. AND customer: Yes, it’s 45911.\" should have the same intent: provide_order_number.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Address Overlapping Intent Stages:**\n",
      "   - Provide examples and guidelines for handling messages that span multiple conversation stages, such as transitioning from providing a solution to closing the conversation.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: assistant: You’re welcome! Have a nice day. AND assistant: Happy to help!\" should have the same intent: close_conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Role-Specific Cues and Contextual Analysis:**\n",
      "   - Consider the speaker's role and broader conversational context when assigning intents. This helps reduce errors like false merges due to misinterpretation of the speaker’s role.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: customer: Great, how long will the refund take? AND customer: Great, when will I see the refund?\" should have the same intent: ask_refund_timeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Incorporate Common Error Examples:**\n",
      "   - Include examples of common errors, such as false merges and splits, to illustrate why certain messages should be grouped or separated. This aids in improving accuracy.\n",
      "   - Example: \"Message: customer: Okay, I’ll do that now. Thanks for your support! AND customer: Great, thanks a lot.\" should have separate intents: acknowledge_and_thank AND express_gratitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Encourage Thorough Contextual Analysis:**\n",
      "   - Emphasize the need for comprehensive analysis of the entire conversation, including preceding and following messages, to ensure accurate and consistent intent labeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these guidelines, you can effectively guide users in accurately identifying and clustering intents, thereby improving the quality of the analysis process.\n",

      "   - Use an existing intent label if it already covers the message. \n",
      "   - Group similar phrases under the same intent if they serve the same purpose, such as \"Glad I could help!\" and \"Happy to help!\" both labeled as close_conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Precision in Intent Assignment:**\n",
      "   - Differentiate between intents that occur closely in conversation but serve different functions. For example, separate express_gratitude (\"Thank you for helping me.\") from close_conversation (\"You’re welcome! Have a great day.\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Determine Intent Boundaries:**\n",
      "   - Use specific cues to distinguish when a message transitions between intents, such as agreement or task completion to differentiate between acknowledge and accept_solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Reference Common Intents:**\n",
      "   - Familiarize yourself with common intents like close_conversation and express_gratitude. Use these intents before creating new ones unless necessary, supported by multiple examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Contextual Clues for Similar Actions:**\n",
      "   - Look for contextual clues in messages to accurately assign intents, such as recognizing numbers as order IDs for intents like provide_order_number.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Intent Creation Criteria:**\n",
      "   - Create a new intent only if the message introduces a new, unaddressed issue. Provide examples of messages that warrant new intents.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Intent Hierarchy and Decision Tree:**\n",
      "   - Utilize a hierarchy or decision tree to guide intent assignment, balancing specificity and generalization to avoid false splits and merges.\n",

      "Updated Prompt: You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message, ensuring clarity and consistency based on the following guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Gratitude vs. Acceptance**: Differentiate between expressions of gratitude and acceptance. Use `express_gratitude` for messages purely expressing thanks, and `accept_solution` for messages acknowledging receipt or acceptance of a solution. Look for cues such as \"thank you\" vs. \"okay, that works.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Closing Statements**: Identify various forms of closing statements that indicate the end of a conversation. Use `close_conversation` for messages such as \"Have a nice day,\" \"Glad I could help,\" or any similar variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Service-Related Details**: Distinguish messages providing service-related details, like order numbers or bill IDs, with `provide_order_number`. Ensure consistency across similar messages by looking for numeric identifiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Contextual Understanding**: Apply a contextual approach to intent labeling. For instance, use `acknowledge` for messages like \"Okay, thanks for letting me know,\" and \"Okay, let me check,\" focusing on the conversational flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Examples for Subtle Differences**: Utilize examples to understand subtle differences in intent. For instance, \"Awesome, I appreciate it,\" and \"Perfect, thanks for the quick help,\" should both be labeled as `express_gratitude`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Intent Consistency**: Maintain consistency in labeling similar expressions of intent, regardless of minor phrasing differences. For example, label both \"Happy to assist! Have a good evening.\" and \"You’re very welcome.\" as `close_conversation`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Existing vs. New Intents**: Use an existing intent label if it covers the message. Create a new intent only if the message introduces a distinct issue not covered by existing intents.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these structured guidelines, the clustering of customer service messages will be more accurate and well-organized, reducing errors in intent identification.\n",

      "Updated Prompt: You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message by following these guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarify Intent Overlap and Separation:**\n",
      "   - Differentiate between similar expressions with different intents. For example, recognize subtle distinctions between \"express_gratitude\" and \"accept_solution\" when a customer says 'Perfect, thank you.' versus 'Great, thank you.'.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Define Intent Boundaries Clearly:**\n",
      "   - Use specific definitions and examples to distinguish between intents. For instance, clarify the difference between \"acknowledge\" (e.g., 'Okay, good to know.') and \"accept_solution\" (e.g., 'That would be good.').\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Assignment:**\n",
      "   - Ensure consistent labeling, especially in closing conversations. For example, 'assistant: Glad I could help!' and 'assistant: Happy to help!' should both be labeled as \"close_conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**\n",
      "   - Consider the conversational context when determining intents for both customer and assistant messages. Distinguish between \"express_gratitude\" and \"close_conversation\" in interactions like 'customer: Okay, thanks for the quick check.' and 'assistant: You’re welcome!'.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Introduce Disambiguation Cues:**\n",
      "   - Use disambiguation cues for intents that are often misclassified. For example, differentiate between \"provide_order_number\" and \"provide_bill_id\" in messages like 'Yes, it’s 58291.' versus 'It’s 78342.'.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Prioritize Intent Specificity:**\n",
      "   - Perform a detailed analysis of message content to prevent false merges. Distinguish \"express_gratitude\" (e.g., 'Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me.') from \"close_conversation\" (e.g., 'You’re welcome! Have a great day.').\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Highlight Common Misclassification Patterns:**\n",
      "   - Identify frequent misclassification patterns to prevent errors. For instance, ensure both 'You’re welcome! Have a great day.' and 'Alright, have a good day!' are labeled \"close_conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Disambiguate Similar Intents**: Differentiate between similar intents by understanding their nuances. For example, \"Perfect, thank you.\" should be labeled as \"accept_solution,\" while \"Thanks a lot!\" should be labeled as \"express_gratitude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Avoid False Splits**: Look for commonalities in messages to avoid unnecessary splitting of intents. For instance, both \"Awesome, I appreciate it.\" and \"Perfect, thanks for the quick help.\" should be categorized under \"express_gratitude.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Handle Mixed Intents**: When messages contain mixed intents, such as \"Okay, thanks for the quick check,\" prioritize the primary intent or consider splitting into multiple labels if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Understand Context**: Consider the context of the conversation to ensure consistent intent labeling. For example, \"You’re welcome! Have a nice day.\" should be consistently labeled as \"close_conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Role-Specific Intent Consistency**: Recognize the differences in intent labeling between customer and assistant messages. Ensure messages like \"You’re welcome! Have a nice day.\" (assistant) and \"Perfect, thank you.\" (customer) are distinctly labeled to reflect role-specific intents.\n",
      "\n",

      "1. **Clarify Existing Intent Labels:**\n",
      "   - Use existing intent labels with clear definitions to reduce ambiguity. For instance, \"express_gratitude\" is used for messages that convey thanks, while \"acknowledge_and_thank\" is for messages that acknowledge information and express gratitude.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Evaluate New Intent Necessity:**\n",
      "   - Create new intents only when a message introduces a truly distinct issue. Evaluate whether the message is unique enough to warrant a separate intent to avoid unnecessary splits.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Use Disambiguation Cues:**\n",
      "   - Look for specific keywords or phrases in messages as cues for assigning intents. Phrases like \"thank you\" typically indicate \"express_gratitude,\" while resolutions or farewells often suggest \"close_conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Examples of Correct Intent Assignment:**\n",
      "   - Refer to examples of accurately assigned intents to guide your evaluation and ensure precision in intent clustering.\n",

      "6. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrasing:**\n",
      "   - Maintain consistency for messages with similar phrasing or sentiment. For example, \"Glad I could help!\" and \"Happy to help!\" should have the same intent, such as \"close_conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Consider Contextual Transitions:**\n",
      "   - Use context to determine intent, especially when messages transition between different phases of the conversation. This helps in understanding natural progressions, such as from \"express_gratitude\" to \"close_conversation.\"\n",
