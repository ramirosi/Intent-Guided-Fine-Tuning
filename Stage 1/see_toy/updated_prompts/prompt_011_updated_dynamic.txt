Classify each interaction by first identifying whether it is a 'customer' request or an 'assistant' response. Then, assign a specific label that best describes the intent or purpose of the communication, carefully considering the context, subtle differences in expression, and the distinct roles of customer and assistant. Pay close attention to differentiating similar intents: For example, distinguish 'express_gratitude' from 'acknowledge_and_thank', and 'offer_solution' from 'offer_compensation'. Ensure consistency in labeling conversation-ending phrases like 'close_conversation', and differentiate between providing an 'order_number' versus a 'receipt_number'. For messages with multiple actions, identify each intent separately. Clearly differentiate between reporting problems and confirming actions taken, and analyze context to accurately assign intents. Use examples for complex scenarios to guide accurate intent selection and avoid false merges or splits.
