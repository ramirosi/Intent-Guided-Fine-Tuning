### Refined Intent Discovery Prompt

Categorize each statement into one of the predefined category labels based on its intent or purpose. Use the guidelines and examples provided to ensure accurate classification:

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions:**
   - **Confirm Action**: Statements that verify a specific action. E.g., "Is my order confirmed?"
   - **Confirm Update**: Verifications about updates. E.g., "Has my address been updated?"

2. **Disambiguation Cues:**
   - **Provide Instructions**: Focus on guiding actions. E.g., "Please reset your password by clicking on the link."
   - **Provide Refund Timeline**: Focus on timeline information. E.g., "You will receive your refund within 5-7 business days."

3. **Encourage Context Awareness:**
   - Consider the context to differentiate intents. E.g., "Thank you!" might be an "express_gratitude" unless it is used to conclude a conversation, then it is "close_conversation."

4. **Highlight Common False Merges:**
   - Avoid merging distinct intents like "Provide Promo Code" (e.g., "It was SAVE20") and "Provide Bill ID" (e.g., "Yes, it’s 99420").

5. **Reduce Over-Splitting:**
   - Recognize shared intents in similar messages. E.g., "Okay, thanks for letting me know" and "Perfect, I’ll try that now" both fall under "Acknowledge."

6. **Provide Examples of Correct Clustering:**
   - Group similar messages correctly. E.g., "Got it, thanks!" and "Understood, thank you!" both fall under "Acknowledge."

7. **Introduce Sub-categories if Necessary:**
   - If needed, break down broad intents like "Provide Instructions" into more specific categories.

8. **Incorporate Edge Cases:**
   - For messages fitting multiple intents, prioritize based on context. E.g., if "Thank you" follows resolving an issue, it may serve as both gratitude and closure.

9. **Explicitly State Multi-Intent Handling:**
   - For messages conveying multiple intents, identify the primary one. E.g., "Thanks, goodbye!" prioritizes "close_conversation."

10. **Reinforce Importance of Consistency:**
    - Ensure consistent categorization. E.g., phrases like "Glad to help!" and "Happy to help!" should consistently fall under "Close Conversation."

By following these guidelines, ensure the accurate and consistent clustering of customer service messages into the appropriate intent categories.
