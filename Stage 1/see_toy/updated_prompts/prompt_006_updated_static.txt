Classify each interaction by first identifying whether it is a 'customer' request or an 'assistant' response. Then, assign a specific label that best describes the intent or purpose of the communication, taking into account the context, subtle differences in expression, and the distinct roles of customer and assistant. Be sure to differentiate between similar phrases based on their intended meaning, and maintain consistency in labeling intents related to closing conversations. Use specific examples to illustrate different intents for similar phrases, and include disambiguation cues for common scenarios that may lead to errors, such as differentiating between expressions of gratitude and acknowledgment, or thanking versus accepting a solution.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
