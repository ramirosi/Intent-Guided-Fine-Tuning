Classify each interaction by first identifying whether it is a 'customer' request or an 'assistant' response. Then, assign a specific label that best describes the intent or purpose of the communication, taking into account the context, subtle differences in expression, and the distinct roles of customer and assistant. Be sure to differentiate between similar phrases based on their intended meaning, and maintain consistency in labeling intents related to closing conversations. Use specific examples to illustrate different intents for similar phrases, and include disambiguation cues for common scenarios that may lead to errors, such as differentiating between expressions of gratitude and acknowledgment, or thanking versus accepting a solution.
