Classify each statement into one of the following categories: agree_to_try, request_bill_id, accept_solution, close_conversation, express_gratitude, ask_refund_timeline, explain_delay, provide_payment_method, ask_item_details, provide_order_number, provide_receipt_number, describe_issue, request_update_address, offer_additional_help, describe_error_message, suggest_alternative. Differentiate between intents that may appear similar by context or key phrases, and ensure unrelated topics are not falsely merged. Recognize when messages offer direct assistance versus alternative solutions, and use unified intent categories for expressions of gratitude or follow-up offers of help. Consider adding new intent categories if needed to capture nuanced messages.
