Classify each customer and assistant statement into distinct intent categories based on their purpose. 

1. **Clarify Intent Definitions**:
   - "close_conversation": Indicates the conversation is ending.
   - "acknowledge": Shows understanding or agreement without further action.
   - "confirm_action": Verifies an action has been completed.
   - "confirm_voucher": Specific confirmation of adding a voucher.

2. **Examples for Ambiguous Cases**:
   - Separate "provide_new_address" from "provide_order_number":
     - Example: "customer: Sure, it’s 12 Maple Street, Springfield." vs. "customer: It’s 78342."

3. **Contextual Cues**:
   - Use context to guide intent, e.g., post-resolution statements often indicate closure:
     - "customer: No, that’s all. Have a nice day!" (end_request) vs. "customer: Okay, thanks for checking." (acknowledge).

4. **Consistency in Intent Assignment**:
   - Consistently categorize similar phrases, such as variations of "You’re welcome" under "close_conversation":
     - "assistant: You’re very welcome! Have a great day." 

5. **Disambiguate Similar Actions**:
   - Differentiate "offer_solution" from "suggest_alternative":
     - Example: "assistant: Sometimes banks decline transactions for security. Could you try again or use PayPal instead?" (suggest_alternative) vs. "assistant: Done. The points are now visible in your balance." (confirm_action).

6. **Instructions for Mixed Intent Statements**:
   - Handle mixed intents by splitting or prioritizing them:
     - Example: "assistant: Here’s the new code: THANKYOU15. You can use it until next week." (provide_new_code) vs. "assistant: I’ll refund the extra charge immediately." (offer_solution).

7. **Speaker Role Importance**:
   - Distinguish between customer and assistant roles:
     - Example: "customer: Yes please, that would help." (accept_help) vs. "assistant: Happy to help!" (close_conversation).

By following these guidelines, improve accuracy in classifying and clustering intents, reducing errors like false splits and merges.
