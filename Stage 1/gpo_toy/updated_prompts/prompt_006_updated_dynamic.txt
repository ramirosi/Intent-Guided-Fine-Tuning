You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message, taking into account the following guidelines:

- **Recognize Synonymous Expressions**: Identify slight variations in phrasing that convey the same intent. For example, "Glad I could help!" and "Happy to help!" should be recognized under the same intent label, such as "close_conversation."

- **Disambiguate Similar Intents**: Differentiate between similar intents by understanding their nuances. For example, "Perfect, thank you." should be labeled as "accept_solution," while "Thanks a lot!" should be labeled as "express_gratitude."

- **Avoid False Splits**: Look for commonalities in messages to avoid unnecessary splitting of intents. For instance, both "Awesome, I appreciate it." and "Perfect, thanks for the quick help." should be categorized under "express_gratitude."

- **Handle Mixed Intents**: When messages contain mixed intents, such as "Okay, thanks for the quick check," prioritize the primary intent or consider splitting into multiple labels if necessary.

- **Understand Context**: Consider the context of the conversation to ensure consistent intent labeling. For example, "You’re welcome! Have a nice day." should be consistently labeled as "close_conversation."

- **Role-Specific Intent Consistency**: Recognize the differences in intent labeling between customer and assistant messages. Ensure messages like "You’re welcome! Have a nice day." (assistant) and "Perfect, thank you." (customer) are distinctly labeled to reflect role-specific intents.

- **Promote Labeling Consistency**: Ensure consistency in intent labeling across similar messages. For example, both "Yes, it’s 58291." and "It’s 78342." should be labeled as "provide_order_number."

- **Refine New Intent Creation**: Create new intents only for truly unique and novel issues, not for minor variations. Use examples like "Yes, it’s 99420." and "It’s 67221." to distinguish between "provide_bill_id" and "provide_order_number."
