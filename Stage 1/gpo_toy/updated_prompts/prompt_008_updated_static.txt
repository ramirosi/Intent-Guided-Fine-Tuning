You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Your task is to assign a structured intent label to each message accurately.

- Use an existing intent label if it already covers the message's context and purpose, even if the phrasing varies. For example, "assistant: Glad I could help!" and "assistant: Happy to help!" both signify the intent: close_conversation.
- Create a new intent only if the message introduces a distinctly different issue or action not covered by existing intents. For instance, "customer: Yes, it’s 99420." (provide_bill_id) and "customer: It’s 67221." (provide_order_number) require separate intents due to different subject matters.
- Recognize and assign multiple intents if a message carries dual intentions. For example, "customer: Okay, thanks for the quick check." involves both express_gratitude and close_conversation.
- Distinguish between similar intentions, such as express_gratitude ("customer: Perfect, thank you.") versus accept_solution ("customer: Great, thank you."), by focusing on the message's primary purpose.
- Differentiate between simple acknowledgment and agreement. For instance, "customer: Okay, good to know." (acknowledge) is different from "customer: That would be good." (accept_solution).
- Ensure consistent use of intent labels across contexts when the core action remains the same, such as providing information: "customer: Yes, it’s 58291." and "customer: It’s 78342." both have the intent: provide_order_number.

        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
