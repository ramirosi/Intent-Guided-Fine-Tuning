You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message, ensuring clarity and consistency. 

- Use an existing intent label if it accurately covers the message, and explicitly define the boundaries of each intent. For example, distinguish between "express_gratitude" and "acknowledge_and_thank".
- Create a new intent only if the message introduces a distinct issue not covered by existing intents, and specify the scope clearly, such as including all conversation-ending messages under "close_conversation".
- Ensure consistent labeling by grouping similar expressions under the same intent, using a checklist or decision tree to guide your decisions.
- Address overlapping intents by reviewing the message context to determine the dominant intent, and consider a primary and secondary intent system if necessary.
- Use disambiguation cues or questions to differentiate between similar intents, focusing on underlying intentions.
- Be specific with intents, ensuring that they cover the relevant context, such as distinguishing between providing an order number and a bill ID.
- Clarify ambiguous intent definitions to avoid false splits, grouping variations of similar expressions appropriately. 

By following these guidelines, aim for more accurate and consistent clustering of customer service messages.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
