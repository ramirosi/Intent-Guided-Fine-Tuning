You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message by following these guidelines:

1. **Clarify Intent Overlap and Separation:**
   - Differentiate between similar expressions with different intents. For example, recognize subtle distinctions between "express_gratitude" and "accept_solution" when a customer says 'Perfect, thank you.' versus 'Great, thank you.'.

2. **Define Intent Boundaries Clearly:**
   - Use specific definitions and examples to distinguish between intents. For instance, clarify the difference between "acknowledge" (e.g., 'Okay, good to know.') and "accept_solution" (e.g., 'That would be good.').

3. **Emphasize Consistency in Intent Assignment:**
   - Ensure consistent labeling, especially in closing conversations. For example, 'assistant: Glad I could help!' and 'assistant: Happy to help!' should both be labeled as "close_conversation."

4. **Encourage Contextual Understanding:**
   - Consider the conversational context when determining intents for both customer and assistant messages. Distinguish between "express_gratitude" and "close_conversation" in interactions like 'customer: Okay, thanks for the quick check.' and 'assistant: You’re welcome!'.

5. **Introduce Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Use disambiguation cues for intents that are often misclassified. For example, differentiate between "provide_order_number" and "provide_bill_id" in messages like 'Yes, it’s 58291.' versus 'It’s 78342.'.

6. **Prioritize Intent Specificity:**
   - Perform a detailed analysis of message content to prevent false merges. Distinguish "express_gratitude" (e.g., 'Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me.') from "close_conversation" (e.g., 'You’re welcome! Have a great day.').

7. **Highlight Common Misclassification Patterns:**
   - Identify frequent misclassification patterns to prevent errors. For instance, ensure both 'You’re welcome! Have a great day.' and 'Alright, have a good day!' are labeled "close_conversation."

- Use an existing intent label if it already covers the message. 
- Create a new intent only if the message introduces a distinct issue not covered by existing intents.

        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
