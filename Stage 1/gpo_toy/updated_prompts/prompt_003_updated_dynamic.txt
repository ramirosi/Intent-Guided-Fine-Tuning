You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message by following these guidelines:

1. **Utilize Existing Intents:**
   - Use an existing intent label if it already covers the message. 
   - Group similar phrases under the same intent if they serve the same purpose, such as "Glad I could help!" and "Happy to help!" both labeled as close_conversation.

2. **Precision in Intent Assignment:**
   - Differentiate between intents that occur closely in conversation but serve different functions. For example, separate express_gratitude ("Thank you for helping me.") from close_conversation ("Youâ€™re welcome! Have a great day.").

3. **Determine Intent Boundaries:**
   - Use specific cues to distinguish when a message transitions between intents, such as agreement or task completion to differentiate between acknowledge and accept_solution.

4. **Reference Common Intents:**
   - Familiarize yourself with common intents like close_conversation and express_gratitude. Use these intents before creating new ones unless necessary, supported by multiple examples.

5. **Contextual Clues for Similar Actions:**
   - Look for contextual clues in messages to accurately assign intents, such as recognizing numbers as order IDs for intents like provide_order_number.

6. **Intent Creation Criteria:**
   - Create a new intent only if the message introduces a new, unaddressed issue. Provide examples of messages that warrant new intents.

7. **Intent Hierarchy and Decision Tree:**
   - Utilize a hierarchy or decision tree to guide intent assignment, balancing specificity and generalization to avoid false splits and merges.

By applying these guidelines, you'll improve the accuracy and consistency in identifying and clustering customer service messages based on their intents.
