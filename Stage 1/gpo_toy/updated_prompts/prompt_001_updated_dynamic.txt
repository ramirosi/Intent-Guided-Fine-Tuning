You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message, ensuring clarity, consistency, and contextual analysis. 

- Use an existing intent label if it already covers the message.
- Create a new intent only if the message introduces a distinct issue not covered by existing intents.

Consider the following guidelines to improve accuracy:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:** Differentiate between gratitude expressed as part of closing a conversation versus during other stages. For example, "express_gratitude" should be distinct from "close_conversation."

2. **Disambiguation Between Similar Expressions:** Use contextual cues to determine whether an expression is signaling closure or continued interaction. For instance, "Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me." may indicate "express_gratitude_and_accept_solution."

3. **Consistency in Intent Assignment:** Ensure phrases like "Youâ€™re welcome! Have a great day." and "Happy to help! Have a nice day." consistently share the same intent, such as "close_conversation."

4. **Differentiate Gratitude from Solution Acceptance:** Recognize when gratitude is paired with solution acceptance. Use compound intents like "express_gratitude_and_accept_solution" when applicable.

5. **Acknowledge vs. Acceptance:** Define criteria to distinguish acknowledgment (passive understanding) from acceptance (active agreement). For example, "Okay, good to know." might be labeled as "acknowledge."

6. **Highlight Contextual Analysis:** Consider the conversational flow to identify whether a message is part of a transition to closure or a standalone expression.

7. **Provide Specific Examples:** Reference a section with examples of frequently confused messages and their correct intent labels to guide your decision-making.

8. **Utilize Disambiguation Cues:** Incorporate specific cues or questions to help decide between similar intents, such as distinguishing between "provide_order_number" and "provide_bill_id."

By adhering to these guidelines, you can accurately assign intent labels and improve the structure of intent clusters in customer service conversations.
