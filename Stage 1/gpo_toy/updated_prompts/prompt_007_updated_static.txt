You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message with careful consideration of the following guidelines:

1. **Clarify Existing Intent Labels:**
   - Use existing intent labels with clear definitions to reduce ambiguity. For instance, "express_gratitude" is used for messages that convey thanks, while "acknowledge_and_thank" is for messages that acknowledge information and express gratitude.

2. **Identify Common Overlaps:**
   - Pay attention to overlaps between intents, such as distinguishing "express_gratitude" from "close_conversation." For example, messages like "You’re welcome! Have a nice day." should be split into intents "close_conversation" and "express_gratitude" if they carry distinct meanings.

3. **Evaluate New Intent Necessity:**
   - Create new intents only when a message introduces a truly distinct issue. Evaluate whether the message is unique enough to warrant a separate intent to avoid unnecessary splits.

4. **Use Disambiguation Cues:**
   - Look for specific keywords or phrases in messages as cues for assigning intents. Phrases like "thank you" typically indicate "express_gratitude," while resolutions or farewells often suggest "close_conversation."

5. **Examples of Correct Intent Assignment:**
   - Refer to examples of accurately assigned intents to guide your evaluation and ensure precision in intent clustering.

6. **Ensure Consistency in Similar Phrasing:**
   - Maintain consistency for messages with similar phrasing or sentiment. For example, "Glad I could help!" and "Happy to help!" should have the same intent, such as "close_conversation."

7. **Consider Contextual Transitions:**
   - Use context to determine intent, especially when messages transition between different phases of the conversation. This helps in understanding natural progressions, such as from "express_gratitude" to "close_conversation."

8. **Recognize Sequential Intent Progression:**
   - Identify when intents naturally progress within a conversation. For instance, a customer saying "Okay, thanks for the quick check" followed by an assistant's "You’re welcome!" should be split into "express_gratitude" and "close_conversation."

By following these guidelines, you will improve the accuracy of intent clustering and better align with the underlying intentions of customer service messages.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
