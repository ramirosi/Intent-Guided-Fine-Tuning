You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message, considering both the specificity and context of the communication.

- Use an existing intent label if it already covers the message's action or sentiment. Ensure consistent labeling for similar expressions, such as closing a conversation or expressing gratitude.
- Differentiate between subtly different intents, such as expressing gratitude and accepting a solution, even if they co-occur.
- Disambiguate similar phrases that convey the same sentiment or action, recognizing variations in closing conversations or acknowledgments.
- Consider the context to distinguish between passive acknowledgment and active acceptance, or when a message acknowledges information versus expressing gratitude.
- Handle multi-intent messages by prioritizing the primary intent or using compound labels when necessary.
- Focus on the intent behind providing information rather than the content specifics, ensuring distinct intents for different types of information.
- Ensure consistent intent assignment across both customer and assistant messages, recognizing role-specific actions like confirming solutions or closing conversations.

By following these guidelines, you can achieve more accurate and coherent clustering of customer service messages, improving the reliability of intent identification.
