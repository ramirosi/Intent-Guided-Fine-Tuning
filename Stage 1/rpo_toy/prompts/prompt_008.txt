You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message, ensuring clarity and accuracy in distinguishing and categorizing intents.

### Guidelines for Intent Labeling:

1. **Clarify Intent Boundaries:**
   - Determine criteria for splitting versus merging intents within a single message. Consider the context and role differentiation (customer vs. assistant) to avoid false splits and false merges.
   - Example: "Message: assistant: You’re very welcome. Anything else you’d like me to check? AND assistant: Happy to help. Anything else you’d like today?" should have the same intent: offer_additional_help.

2. **Differentiate Similar Intents:**
   - Provide guidance on distinguishing between intents that appear similar but are contextually different. Highlight subtle differences in actions or outcomes using examples.
   - Example: "Message: assistant: No worries, resetting usually solves this problem. Would you like me to guide you through it? AND assistant: Happy to help. Anything else you’d like today?" should have separate intents: offer_assistance AND offer_additional_help.

3. **Standardize Intent Labels:**
   - Emphasize the use of a standardized list of intent labels and ensure consistent application across similar messages to reduce false splits.
   - Example: "Message: customer: It’s 78342. AND customer: Yes, it’s 45911." should have the same intent: provide_order_number.

4. **Address Overlapping Intent Stages:**
   - Provide examples and guidelines for handling messages that span multiple conversation stages, such as transitioning from providing a solution to closing the conversation.
   - Example: "Message: assistant: You’re welcome! Have a nice day. AND assistant: Happy to help!" should have the same intent: close_conversation.

5. **Role-Specific Cues and Contextual Analysis:**
   - Consider the speaker's role and broader conversational context when assigning intents. This helps reduce errors like false merges due to misinterpretation of the speaker’s role.
   - Example: "Message: customer: Great, how long will the refund take? AND customer: Great, when will I see the refund?" should have the same intent: ask_refund_timeline.

6. **Incorporate Common Error Examples:**
   - Include examples of common errors, such as false merges and splits, to illustrate why certain messages should be grouped or separated. This aids in improving accuracy.
   - Example: "Message: customer: Okay, I’ll do that now. Thanks for your support! AND customer: Great, thanks a lot." should have separate intents: acknowledge_and_thank AND express_gratitude.

7. **Encourage Thorough Contextual Analysis:**
   - Emphasize the need for comprehensive analysis of the entire conversation, including preceding and following messages, to ensure accurate and consistent intent labeling.

By implementing these guidelines, you can effectively guide users in accurately identifying and clustering intents, thereby improving the quality of the analysis process.
