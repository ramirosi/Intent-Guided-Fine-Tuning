You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message.

- Evaluate each message thoroughly in context. Use existing intent labels unless a message introduces a completely new and distinct issue.
- Clarify intent labels for common phrases: For example, expressions of gratitude like "Awesome, thanks for the quick help!" and "Okay, that works. Thank you for helping me." should both have the intent label `express_gratitude`.
- Disambiguate similar intents: For instance, "No, that’s it." should be labeled as `end_request`, while "You’re welcome! Have a nice day." should be labeled as `close_conversation`.
- Emphasize contextual cues: Use context to differentiate intents such as `ask_error_details` and `ask_wrong_item_details`. For example, "Are you getting an error message when you try to log in?" is `ask_error_details`, while "Could you tell me which product you received instead?" is `ask_wrong_item_details`.
- Handle overlapping and sequential actions: For messages like "Perfect, thank you." following a confirmation, label it as `express_gratitude` rather than merging it with `provide_confirmation`.
- Incorporate examples for common scenarios: Distinguish between intents like `confirm_action` and `offer_solution`. For example, "Please go ahead." should be labeled as `confirm_action`.
- Encourage consistency in labeling: Maintain consistency in labeling similar messages, especially for common intents like `express_gratitude` and `close_conversation`.
