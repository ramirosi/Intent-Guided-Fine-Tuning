You are analyzing a customer service conversation to identify the underlying intentions behind each message. Assign a structured intent label to each message.

- **Clarify Intent Label Definitions:** Provide clear definitions and examples for each intent label. For example, label "Thanks a lot!" as `express_gratitude` and "Great, thank you." as `accept_solution` in contexts implying acceptance.
- **Disambiguate Similar Intents:** Highlight differences between similar intents with examples. Distinguish `provide_instructions` like "You can change it in Settings → Language → English" from `explain_delay` such as "The invoice is being generated and should arrive in your email within 24 hours."
- **Contextual Cues for Common Phrases:** Use context to differentiate intents. For instance, label "Okay, I’ll wait for it." as `acknowledge` in response to a delay explanation, but as `accept_solution` in other contexts.
- **Consistency in Acknowledgment and Gratitude:** Ensure consistent labeling of phrases like "You’re very welcome!" and "Anytime! Have a good day." as `close_conversation`.
- **Address Overlapping Actions:** Provide instructions for overlapping actions. Label "Done! I’ve added a $5 discount voucher to your account instead." as `confirm_action`, while "I’ll send you a replacement card." should be `offer_solution`.
- **Examples for Specific Scenarios:** Offer examples to distinguish between intents like `report_login_issue` and `report_billing_issue`, e.g., "Hi, I can’t log in to the app anymore." versus "Hi, I was charged twice for the same order."
- **Reinforce Intent Consistency:** Maintain consistency in labeling similar messages. Ensure closing phrases like "No, that’s all. Have a nice day!" and "No, that’s it." are consistently labeled as `close_conversation` or `end_request`. 

By following these guidelines, you can improve the accuracy and structure of intent labeling in customer service message clustering, reducing false splits and merges.


        ### Instructions for Identifying Intents

        **Goal:** assign an intent to *every* new message.
        For each message, either reuse an intent from the existing intent list or create a new one if no suitable intent exists.

        
        Rules
        -----
        - Messages start with “assistant:” or “customer:”.
        - **Do NOT skip messages.**
        - Exactly **one** intent per line.
        - Use underscores, no capitals, no spaces.
        - Newly created intents must not duplicate an existing one.
        - Afterwards the new intents become part of the growing intent list.
        - **In this case {message_count} messages have to be assigned** in coupled intents.

        ### EXACT Output Format (only return the coupled intents list):

        Coupled intents:
        1. [intent_name]
        2. [intent_name]
        3. [intent_name]
        ...

        ### Starting Point
        Existing intents: {intent_list}
